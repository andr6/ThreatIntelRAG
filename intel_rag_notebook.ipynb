These scams often attract individuals with promises of high returns or use sophisticated schemes to defraud even the most cautious. Understanding these scams is crucial for protecting potential victims and safely navigating the evolving cryptocurrency scene. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake technology, scams exploiting famous personalities and major events have significantly increased since these technologies enable the creation of realistic but fake videos. Consequently, dozens of scams try to leverage the popularity and credibility of celebrities or significant events to deceive as many people as possible.\\n\\nScammers use various media to distribute fake pages and videos. By using different platforms, they can reach a large audience and increase the probability of attracting more people with fraudulent content. The first documented medium used by scammers for this purpose was X, at the time Twitter, in 2018. Specifically, scammers took over three popular and verified Twitter accounts of British fashion retailer Matalan, film distributor Pathe UK, and US publisher Pantheon Books. The attackers used Elon Musk’s name and likeness to promote a fraud ad via Tweets. [1]. Since at least 2019, hackers have also been hijacking high-profile YouTube channels to broadcast cryptocurrency scams.\\n\\nIn an effort to combat these hijacks, Google has spent considerable time researching techniques used by hackers-for-hire that were used to compromise thousands of YouTube creators. Nevertheless, this has not completely stopped scammers, who still manage to hijack accounts from time to time [2, 3]. The issue gained enough importance to attract the interest of other researchers, motivating several scientific publications that tried to address the issue of crypto scams on various platforms, starting from the aforementioned YouTube and Twitter and including other platforms that have gained prominence in recent years, such as TikTok, Telegram, and WhatsApp [4-9].\\n\\nIt is to no one’s surprise that these sources describe very similar modus operandi and associated techniques across all these platforms. The deepfakes utilizing AI are naturally becoming key instruments in crypto scam campaigns. In recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of one specific scam based on giveaway events announced by abused events and well-known personalities. The group we dubbed CryptoCore has become famous for its sophisticated tactics and successful exploitation of unsuspecting victims. This scam group and its giveaway campaigns leverage deepfake technology, hijacked YouTube accounts, and professionally designed websites to deceive users into sending their cryptocurrencies to the scammers’ wallets.\\n\\nThis report delves into the intricacies of the CryptoCore group’s scam and analyses their modus operandi. We will describe key exploited events, including hijacked YouTube accounts and deepfake videos, alongside a technical analysis of the fraudulent sites. One purpose of this study is to present a fundamental analysis – and key statistics – of fraudulent wallets that have received profits in the millions of dollars, as well as provide statistical data on detections, showing how victims are lured into suspicious websites and ultimately end up crypto scam victims.\\n\\nBy gathering information and insights on the CryptoCore group’s operations and giveaway scams to better understand how they operate and how they manipulate victims, we hope to help counter their operations and protect the digital world.\\n\\nTable of Content\\n\\nModus Operandi\\n\\nThe primary attack vector relies on a simple exploitation of trust in established brands and famous individuals as well as the interest in major cultural and political events. The most common method is convincing a potential victim that messages or events published online are official communication from a trusted social media account or event page, thereby piggybacking on the trust associated with the chosen brand, person, or event. This initial vector usually directs the victim to a fake website that promises quick and easy profits. To pressure the victim even more, they often use limited time “giveaway” offers that urge the person to complete a quick action. Otherwise, they will allegedly lose the opportunity for a quick profit.\\n\\nThe initial attack vector most commonly manifests as events where famous people invest a certain sum of money to raise awareness about an allegedly promising cryptocurrency that targets new cryptocurrency users. They often try to add further confusion and make the distinction more difficult by associating themselves with actual events, usually related to technology, such as space flights or fake seminars focused on cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nThe success of the CryptoCore group is driven by their extensive preparation before an abused event, sophisticated infrastructure, and ability to expose fraudulent content to as many people as possible via popular social platforms.\\n\\nBefore publishing malicious content, usually a video with a QR code linking to a fraudulent website, attackers must set up an environment for sharing their content, which, if successful, will lead victims to the fake page. They need to hijack an account with many subscribers/followers. Documented cases of successful hacks on YouTube users with large follower bases usually begin through phishing or malware in emails; the malware can then steal the session or credentials. The phishing email might inform the account holder, for instance, about changes in YouTube’s terms or propose cooperation in advertising on the account holder’s YouTube account [2]. A similar approach is used for account holders on other popular social platforms.\\n\\nThe attackers prepare deepfake content in advance and wait for an opportunity that can attract a larger audience. On the day of the event, they modify the account by changing the background and description and adding fake content to enhance authenticity. Finally, they wait for victims to search for the official event. Given the high number of subscribers of the hijacked account, there is a high probability that the search results will predominantly show fake content. Keywords related to the targeted events, combined with a large number of followers/subscribers, place hijacked accounts in the top search results.\\n\\nOnce the victim is convinced that this is a unique event, they are redirected to the fraud website, which is highly professional-looking including “technical support” available via online chat. Additionally, the instructions, rules of the “unique event”, and crypto wallets are present on the website, including a fake transaction system to make the page appear more legitimate. The catch is that – if the victims send the money – there is no way to retrieve it back.\\n\\nExample of CryptoCore fraudulent websites\\n\\nReconstructing the Scammers’ Operation\\n\\nBased on the assessed modus operandi, we see strong indications of a large and complex scam operation using a vast array of techniques and scam methods. Their techniques utilize several key tools essential to their campaigns’ success.\\n\\nCryptoCore components\\n\\nThe first step is to attract the largest audience and potential victims. To do this, the group identifies significant events that will be widely publicized and accompanied by live broadcasts. The second step is creating a deepfake video mimicking official event video and abusing the events via embedded QR codes that lead to fraudulent websites. Technical analysis proves these scam websites are generated using the same patterns and framework.\\n\\nOnce the fake videos and websites are ready, the attackers distribute them using compromised accounts from popular platforms, especially YouTube. Therefore, another crucial part of the operation is procuring these compromised accounts because accounts with many subscribers increase the probability of attracting victims. In addition, fake comments also supplement the distribution of the abused event. Finally, the successful campaign results in collecting cryptocurrency wallets with fraudulently obtained crypto coins.\\n\\nSearch Engines\\n\\nWe have figured out how victims are led to fake videos or hijacked accounts; it is a crucial part of the scammers’ operation because it is primarily designed to be multiplatform. The initial phase is observed mainly on desktop platforms, while the landing page is directed towards smart devices via QR codes.\\n\\nMost victims reach the fraudulent videos by searching for keywords related to the exploited events in popular search engines, such as “ spacex starship launch 4 “, “ starship flight test “, and “ start starship “. Another direct access point is searching for keywords directly on YouTube, such as “ eclipse 2024 totality “, “ integrated flight test four “, and “ spaceship “. In addition to direct searches, we have observed fake or misused comments on various forums and posts on platforms X, Facebook, and Twitch. See examples below.\\n\\nLinks to the scam videos from different social networks\\n\\nCryptoProject in Scammer Operations\\n\\nWe have named the scammer group after the framework used to generate the landing pages – CryptoCore. However, the campaigns might be the result of collaboration between several independent cybercriminal groups, possibly through subcontracting.\\n\\nLanding pages are created using a framework advertised on various hacker forums under the brand CryptoProject. The developers offer deployment on personal domains for approximately $100 and even showcase examples of the giveaway campaigns that we have been monitoring, as illustrated in the images below. Orders for specific pages can be placed via their dedicated Telegram bot.\\n\\nCryptoProject ad\\n\\nInterestingly, deepfake videos and even stolen accounts or comments can be procured in a similar way. That means that all the necessary tools are available as a service. This leads to the natural question of whether the whole scam campaign can be procured via a service and the client only needs to supply crypto wallets (basically Scam-as-a-Service), or rather, this is the work of a single group potentially subcontracting parts of its campaign.\\n\\nRegardless, we can assert with high confidence that landing pages are created using a framework that is available as a service, presumably we could probably extend this assessment even to its parts, such as deepfake videos, hijacked accounts, and fake comments. Further research is needed to reveal more details about other links, especially on the fraudulent crypto wallets, which could rule out one of these options.\\n\\nCrypto Wallet Analysis\\n\\nOver a six-month timeframe analysis, we found hundreds of crypto wallets with millions of dollars in turnover. However, it is essential to note that adding up all incoming transactions for each wallet is insufficient to determine the final value because it is necessary to deduct outgoing transactions in BTC from the same wallet. We also recorded large transactions unrelated to any giveaway campaigns, presumably representing transfers between the scammers’ wallets. Nevertheless, the wallets evidently belong to the attackers and not to a middleman. Therefore, the following statistical data on crypto wallets is not exact but provides a basic overview of the approximate range of revenues generated from the group’s illegal activities.\\n\\nIn total, we detected 1200 crypto wallets, with the most frequently used currencies being Ethereum, Bitcoin, Tether, and Dogecoin, as shown in the graph below.\\n\\nDistribution of crypto wallets abused by the scammers, including values\\n\\nThese wallets had a turnover of approximately $5,400,000. The table below summarizes the transaction details for each wallet. In absolute values, Bitcoin wallets represent the largest share of the total turnover due to Bitcoin’s high value, with Ethereum wallets coming in second. The complete list of collected crypto wallets can be found in the IoC section below.\\n\\nWallet Value BTC $ 3,229,752 ETH $ 1,651,163 DOGE $ 238,724 SOL $ 102,294 XRP $ 188,441 $ 5,410,377\\n\\nHijacked YouTube Accounts\\n\\nSince YouTube remains the most popular video-sharing platform with billions of users worldwide, scammers actively exploit its authentication mechanisms. Previous analyses and blog posts have recorded hundreds of suspicious accounts. The most hijacked accounts can be accounted for by two cases, one with 19 million subscribers and another with nearly 12 million [4, 10]. During our observations, accounts with 5 million subscribers were not uncommon. Such high subscriber counts allowed scammers to appear in the top 10 search results.\\n\\nHijacked accounts are among the top 10 in the search results\\n\\nWhile the channels evade YouTube’s detections (and subsequent blocking), they are thematically adjusted to suit the current campaign’s needs. One channel might have channel names like MicroStrategy, Tesla, SpaceX, Ripple, etc. Typically, the background image, channel name, description, and alias (e.g., @RippleXRP24 , @MicroStrategys ) are changed, often relying on typo-squatting to confuse victims. Attackers also switch the original owner’s videos to private and upload their own content, consequently making the account look as credible as possible, even with verified status and a large subscriber base.\\n\\nIt is evident that these are massive attacks on YouTube accounts with high subscriber counts. If scammers are not targeting a specific event, we observe several hijacked accounts daily, usually themed as MicroStrategy or XRP. However, on the day of a significant global event such as the SpaceX launch, the number of active stolen accounts can rise to dozens.\\n\\nIndividual accounts are blocked or removed by YouTube for violating rules, but not in most cases. Moreover, many misused accounts can only be parked, and some remain active for the next promising event. Therefore, the parked accounts can be used in multiple CryptoCore campaigns before they are blocked. Victims often report that proving account ownership to YouTube is very difficult. Moreover, accounts can be blocked or permanently deleted, including all content. Given the large number of subscribers, the result is a significant loss for the victims, as they have built their profiles over many years.\\n\\nAs mentioned in modus operandi, the accounts are stolen through phishing or malware spread via emails. Previous studies have considered that attackers are shifting away from Gmail to other email providers, primarily using email.cz , seznam.cz , post.cz , and aol.com [2]. One documented case involved cookie theft, giving the attacker access to the account without needing the username, password, or two-factor authentication [11]. In addition, it is also possible that attackers purchase credentials on the dark web.\\n\\nHijacked YouTube Account Statistic\\n\\nWe do not aim to provide a complete statistical analysis of YouTube accounts due to the limited scope of analyzed accounts. However, more than 20% of hijacked accounts in our sample had over a million subscribers. The largest shares, approximately 36%, were accounts with 100K to 500K subscribers. So, the vast majority of stolen accounts have a huge number of followers, especially when we consider that MicroStrategy’s official YouTube account has “only” 39.1K subscribers.\\n\\nNumbers of subscribers of hijacked YouTube accounts\\n\\nSuch high subscriber numbers can be beneficial by boosting search results, resulting in both increased visibility as well as credibility. Regarding topics, most accounts tried to associate themselves with SpaceX events, with the second most popular being MicroStrategy which has been a CryptoCore staple for quite some time. The third significant topic is Ripple. However, we must consider noise in the statistics, as the content may change over time, and a single account can cover multiple topics. To illustrate the scale, the number of viewers for live streams of deepfake videos often reaches into the hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nThe most prevalent topics of hijacked YouTube accounts\\n\\nHijacked YouTube Examples\\n\\nWe witnessed many modifications made to hijacked accounts during this research. The method of manipulation remains consistent, so we will provide one specific example of how the attackers operate and misuse the compromised accounts.\\n\\nThe prime example involves an abused YouTube account with many subscribers (1.46M), fortunately with a happy ending. This account was compromised on May 20, 2024, and rebuilt into an “official” MicroStrategy channel, including modification of the background image and description and uploading videos from MicroStrategy’s official website. The victim’s original videos were hidden or selected as private.\\n\\nIf someone searched for the keyword “MicroStrategy”, the hijacked account appeared second in the result list. However, the channel’s original name remained in the search list despite being renamed. The video contained a well-known deepfake video with a QR code leading to the very familiar fake page. Interestingly, one of the original posts from the victim’s YouTube channel remained on the Community tab; see the animation below. Additionally, we utilized this error to communicate with the support team, as documented in Case 2: Suspicious YouTube Channel. Finally, the hijacked account was terminated the next day.\\n\\nExamples of CryptoCore scam\\n\\nThe rightful owner of the account announced the hacking of his YouTube account\\n\\nIn this case, we have also noticed that the victim had other social media platforms where he announced to this audience that his YouTube account had been compromised and used to spread MicroStrategy and Ripple-related spam. This indicates that the account was live long enough after being hijacked to spread multiple campaigns before YouTube took it down.\\n\\nThe account was recovered after being abused in a scam campaign. Note the lack of content.\\n\\nAfter some time, the account was returned to its owner. However, the alias to the hijacked account is still active. So, the link @REWARD.MS2024 still directs to the victim’s YouTube account.\\n\\nCommunity tab of a hijacked account (and later on, recovered)\\n\\nSince attackers abuse accounts with a large audience and they want to retain access to it for as long as possible, they try to hide their activity to avoid being detected by the rightful owner of the account. Whenever they end a campaign, which usually lasts a few hours, they attempt to restore the account to the previous state. Nevertheless, they are not always diligent in these efforts, and they may miss some details such as channel name or background image.\\n\\nThe examples of original community posts on hijacked YouTube account\\n\\nA common sign of stolen accounts is the community tab, which, despite the masking of the hijacked account, contains posts from the original owners.\\n\\nVideo Policy & Providers’ Safeguards\\n\\nYouTube does define rules and policies for accounts and content visibility, but the effectiveness of its automated scam detection is insufficient. Despite the CryptoCore scam being a longstanding issue known to Google [2], there is no noticeable decrease in scam activities. Instead, major media events (e.g., SpaceX flight tests) are continually exploited with similar patterns that could be automatically detected. Although YouTube has mechanisms to block inappropriate content and accounts, these mechanisms often take more time and effort to respond. YouTube videos and accounts are typically blocked based on user reports, requiring substantial user intervention to trigger the blocking action. Consequently, the hijacked accounts with scam videos were not removed till a few days after the abuse event, as the figure below demonstrates.\\n\\nBlocked scam videos after a few days\\n\\nCloudflare sometimes displays warnings about suspicious content, but this is rare and used primarily for long-running domains. Therefore, we see small proactive activity at the infrastructure level of providers, although the landing pages are generated using the same CryptoCore framework with static artifacts that can be easily identified and blocked.\\n\\nCloudflare warning\\n\\nAbused Events\\n\\nAs described above, the attackers are exploiting various events to attract as many victims as possible. We recorded five significant events during the observed period.\\n\\nAt the beginning of January, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, started selling company shares worth $216 million [12]. Attackers used this event to flood the internet with fake videos claiming Michael Saylor was giving away $100,000,000. This event was continuously misused throughout 2024.\\n\\nAnother significant peak occurred on March 14, 2024, when the SpaceX event during the SpaceX Starship integrated flight test (IFT-3) [13] was exploited. This period saw the highest number of detections.\\n\\nIn mid-March, a fake campaign ran after Reuters released information about a contract in which SpaceX allegedly built a network of hundreds of spy satellites [14].\\n\\nAnother notable peak was on April 8, 2024, during the solar eclipse, when SpaceX’s name was once again abused in a CryptoCore campaign.\\n\\nThe last major campaign occurred on June 6, 2024, during the SpaceX Starship integrated flight test (IFT-4) [15]. Nearly 50 hijacked YouTube accounts were used during this several-day campaign. During this campaign, we identified 84 crypto wallets with 500 transactions with a total value of $1.413M.\\n\\nSpaceX Starship IFT-4 scam video and fraudulent website\\n\\nAdditionally, there are sometimes small campaigns that misuse events of elections or tech companies. The examples below illustrate the landing pages for the WWDC24 Apple developer conference and the “giveaway” of Donald Trump.\\n\\nCryptoCore website abusing the WWDC24 Apple developer conference\\n\\nCryptoCore website abusing the Donald Trump election\\n\\nUse of Deepfake Videos\\n\\nCryptoCore campaigns are complementing YouTube accounts with deepfakes videos. These videos abuse official footage from well-known events, personalities, or companies. For instance, in the case of SpaceX and Elon Musk, we have observed the misuse of videos from events such as the SpaceX All Hands 2024, the Starship Flight Test, and the Starship Update from 2022. For Michael Saylor’s campaigns, the exploited videos feature titles such as “Bitcoin is Digital Energy with Michael Saylor”, “10 Rules for Life with Michael Saylor”, and “The Nature of Energy with Michael Saylor”. Other personalities targeted include Larry Fink (CEO of BlackRock), Vitalik Buterin (programmer and co-founder of Ethereum), and Bradley Garlinghouse (CEO of Ripple Labs).\\n\\nThe compilation of deepfake videos below illustrates the modus operandi and its common theme: a well-known personality talks about a unique chance to double your investment. The videos use fake voices and, in some cases, advanced deepfake techniques like lip-syncing. Typically, these videos are looped every 12 minutes, often preceded by, for example, a countdown for a rocket launch or the start of an online broadcast.\\n\\nDeepfake videos compilation\\n\\nFurthermore, some videos are pre-recorded and published as live streams. For instance, we have seen fresh accounts hosting a video that is about three hours in length, then marked as private, but later, the same content appeared as a live stream on the same account. Sometimes, we have seen captured live streams with added scam-related elements, such as a specific background or a QR code inside the video stream.\\n\\nLive stream capturing the insertion of scam artifacts for the Ethereum topic.\\n\\nLive stream capturing the insertion of scam artifacts for the BlackRock topic\\n\\nDuring the last major crypto campaign, we noted advancements in the usage of deepfake technology. The videos now feature detailed shots of personalities with high-quality lip-syncing, which can easily deceive viewers into believing they are watching an official statement. Additionally, they use parts of the original background, such as large screens, to seamlessly display information related to the scam.\\n\\nLive stream of deepfake video capturing ITF-4 with lip-syncing\\n\\nLive stream of deepfake video capturing Michael Saylor with lip-syncing\\n\\nAdditionally, the misused personalities have published official statements against these scams but are largely ineffective in stopping them [16, 17].\\n\\nOfficial statement on crypto scam\\n\\nFraudulent Websites Statistic\\n\\nThe statistics of information extracted from the exposed pages come from a time window spanning from January to June 2024 (6 months). During this period, we detected 340 different domains containing scams generated through the CryptoCore framework. The graphs below show the distribution of headlines used on these fraudulent websites. In summary, the most exploited themes are MicroStrategy, SpaceX, and Tesla.\\n\\nThe most common titles on fraudulent sites\\n\\nThe most frequently abused topics\\n\\nInterestingly, attackers sometimes change their wallets on fraudulent sites. It may happen when the wallets are flagged on some crypto-scam list. The graph below illustrates how wallets have been changed in two domains over time. Therefore, collecting crypto wallet information is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring of the content on these fraudulent sites.\\n\\nDomains that have changed wallets over time\\n\\nTechnical Analysis\\n\\nWe additionally analyzed the fundamental technical aspects of fake websites and the infrastructure built by the framework. The web design of these websites is predominantly built upon obfuscated Java Scripts. It easily facilitates the concealment of crypto wallets, constants, other features, and variables that shape the dynamically generated content. Similarly, the wallets’ QR codes are generated by another obfuscated JavaScript and stored locally in memory.\\n\\nHTML code of the main page\\n\\nOnline Transaction Dashboard\\n\\nEvery five seconds, random transaction numbers and wallet addresses are generated to simulate completed transactions and increase the event’s credibility.\\n\\nThe wallet definition also includes variables determining how fake online transactions will be randomly generated. A random node is defined for each wallet, containing information about the format for a hash transaction and a recipient wallet, including the prefix and length.\\n\\nCrypto wallet and random transaction definitions\\n\\nTherefore, the resulting effect looks professional and legal, but the hashes and wallets are deliberately abbreviated, so they cannot be verified.\\n\\nFake online transaction system\\n\\nAnti-debug Protection\\n\\nThe JavaScript codes also employ several techniques to prevent detailed inspection of the fraudulent pages. Specific keyboard shortcuts that allow access to implementation details, such as Ctrl+U , Ctrl+S , F12 , etc., are disabled, and a user is redirected to /clarity page with the CryptoCore about page.\\n\\nCryptoCore about page\\n\\nMoreover, the pages also intercept and prohibit copy events; copying for wallet via a button is allowed only via JavaScript code. So, when the “copy address” button is clicked, a defined event is sent to the backend. The API event is structured as: api/event?id=<event> , where <event> is defined for each wallet. Finally, the wallet addresses in the JavaScript code are encrypted using a simple Base64 encoding written in reverse order.\\n\\nOnline Chat\\n\\nThe online chat for communicating with the “support team” is implemented using third-party services such as LiveChat , Tawk.to, and Smartsupp . All three services also offer trial or free versions. On sites launched earlier, we have observed that chats are already often blocked.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, the chats are always functional and ready to communicate with a potential victim on newly launched sites.\\n\\nWeb Crawling Protection\\n\\nBefore the desired page is rendered, attackers implement several mechanisms to prevent simple web crawling. The first mechanism involves managing cookies, which are calculated on the client side based on constants sent during the initial contact with the C2 server. The specific code for deriving the cookies is as follows:\\n\\ndocument.cookie = \"0x=\" + toHex(slowAES.decrypt(c, 2, a, b)) + \"; expires=Wed, 01 Jan 2025 22:22:22 GMT; path=/\";\\n\\nThe constants a , b , and c are defined by the C2 server and are linked to the victim’s IP address. This allows attackers to block selected ISPs better. Additionally, sessions are non-transferable, and if the cookies do not match, the server continually sends a request with the calculation of the current and correct cookies for the given IP address. Hence, if everything matches, the server sends the requested content.\\n\\nThe second mechanism involves checking user agents in the HTTP header. If the user agent is on a blocklist (such as wget , curl , etc.), the web server returns a 403 Forbidden response. Additionally, there is ISP filtering, which results in a 404 Not Found response for blocked ISPs.\\n\\nCloudflare Protection\\n\\nThere was an interesting difference between collected domains and resolved IP addresses. We have collected a total of 340 different domains with suspicious websites but approximately 440 IP addresses. This discrepancy is due to the websites typically hosted behind dynamic reverse proxies. Therefore, we collected many IP addresses.\\n\\nThe overwhelming majority (99%) of these proxies (IPs) are provided by Cloudflare, with only 1% observed using Akamai Technologies. The use of reverse proxies makes it very difficult to track and determine the exact location of the web servers. Additionally, reverse proxies complicate automated web crawling by requiring bot verification.\\n\\nUsed reverse proxies\\n\\nCryptoscam website behind Cloudflare protection\\n\\nHowever, based on historical data from 2021, when the group did not yet use reverse proxies, we have determined that nearly 70% of the web servers were hosted in Russia and 15% in the Netherlands. These web servers were running on Ubuntu with the nginx web server.\\n\\nCountry distribution of former web servers\\n\\nTech Support Chat\\n\\nAn integral part of professional websites and large companies is the support chat. In the case of CryptoCore, chat is implemented using third-party plugins. Previous publications have noted that the chat may be connected to a particular form of LLM [18].\\n\\nSeveral test communications with the purported technical support lead us towards the presumption that there are real people responding to the communication. A few examples of these interactions are shown below. Generally, the support team tries to convince you of their legitimacy. If you inquire about a transaction, you made but did not receive the promised double return, they will ask for the transaction hash or a screenshot. Unsurprisingly, no complaint resulted in a refund.\\n\\nCase 1: Forged Transaction Confirmation\\n\\nWe created a fake screenshot showing a transfer of 0.33 BTC but with a current price of only $600. The support team explicitly questioned the current price amount. This indicates that the support team can respond to images and more complex content (such as suspicious BTC price), presumably ruling out simple LLM-based chatbots.\\n\\nCase 2: Suspicious YouTube Channel\\n\\nIn the second case, we confronted the support team that their wallets were listed on the Crypto Scam Tracker. They responded that it was an official event by Michael Saylor, including a verified YouTube account. Our follow-up argument was that the YouTube account contained posts from another (hijacked) user. This apparent discrepancy was explained as a YouTube error, with no connection to them. A detailed story of this YouTube channel can be found in the Hijacked YouTube Examples section.\\n\\nCase 3: No Transactions on Wallets\\n\\nWe confronted the support team that their transaction dashboard showed numerous transactions, but we needed help finding a transaction on the blockchain. Their response was rather unconvincing. Additionally, they stated there was no way to verify that our investment would be returned.\\n\\nCase 4: Forged Transaction System Dashboard\\n\\nWe again created a fake screenshot showing a BTC transfer and a fake dashboard with the same transaction ID, currency, and amount of BTC. We have asked why we did not receive the payment when the transaction appeared on the dashboard. The brief response claimed the transaction had been paid out and could not be ours.\\n\\nExamples of support team communications\\n\\nDetections\\n\\nDetections related to giveaway scams are focused on the fraudulent pages on desktop and smart devices (mobile smart phones). However, scammers encourage victims to use a smart device and scan a QR code to avoid antivirus solutions because more than 50% of smart devices have no protection [19]. Our telemetry data shows that the hit ratio for CryptoCore detections on desktop and smart platforms is 2:5, which indicates a rather significant success in redirecting victims to generally less protected platforms.\\n\\nOur telemetry also demonstrates a correlation between the detection hits and events abused by the scam groups. In total, we can identify five significant events in the crypto world that have a demonstrable connection to the CryptoCore detections. The details of the abused events are summarized in the section Abused Events.\\n\\nProtected users against the CryptoCore giveaway scam\\n\\nThe countries that are the most affected by CryptoCore risk are the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany. There is also a noticeable difference between users of smart devices and desktop computers. On smart devices, we detected the most scams associated with the IFT-3 event, while on desktop devices, the event related to the solar eclipse – seems to have attracted a larger audience.\\n\\nProtected users and abused topics on smart devices\\n\\nProtected users and abused topics on desktop computers\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe giveaway scam campaign spread by the scam group CryptoCore is a sophisticated operation that exploits the popularity of cryptocurrencies and the trust of users in well-known personalities and events. The scammers use deepfake technology, hijacked YouTube accounts, and professionally designed websites to deceive victims into sending their cryptocurrencies to the scammers’ wallets.\\n\\nCryptoCore has been operating on a large scale for at least five years. The platforms, e.g., YouTube and Cloudflare, block giveaway scams only sporadically or with significant delays, despite the modus operandi remaining unchanged for years. Moreover, we continue to observe several newly hijacked YouTube accounts for each campaign that represent a substantial risk in conjunction with parked accounts from previous campaigns. Additionally, we have documented several cases of hacked accounts where owners had to recover the channels built for many years. Statistics show that nearly 65% of accounts compromised by CryptoCore have over 100k followers, and 20% have over a million subscribers. Therefore, we strongly recommend all YouTube account owners take additional security precautions such as using 2FA and strong passwords, being aware of potential phishing campaigns, regularly checking account activity to detect unauthorized access, ensuring account recovery options (such as another email or phone number), and using reputable antivirus and security software to protect devices from malware that could compromise the accounts.\\n\\nAlthough we primarily focused on YouTube, we have seen similar scam attacks on other platforms, evidently from the same scam group. Previous studies indicate that the group’s activity is extensive; during our six-month observation, we estimated nearly $5.4 million in stolen crypto coins. Moreover, if attackers exploit the right event, they can gain almost $1.5 million within a few days. However, this suggests the group’s annual profit must be significantly higher.\\n\\nTracing the whole attack vector is complicated because scammers split the vector across two platforms. For that reason, redirecting victims to smart devices increases the probability that fraudulent sites will not be detected by antivirus software since many people do not protect their smart devices. Consequently, we observe the highest incidence of fake sites just on smart devices. Everything indicates that such attacks will continue, with the group seeking attractive events to exploit until the targeted platforms effectively protect their users and visitors.\\n\\nNote that we named the scam group as the used scam framework CryptoCore; however, based on the analysis CryptoCore-associated campaigns, the giveaway scam is a complex scam project probably delegated to other paid services, often illegal. Moreover, the deepfake videos have continuously improved over the observed year. In terms of directions for future research, further work could analyze the collected crypto wallets.\\n\\nUsers must stay informed about these scam risks. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, so will the scams that exploit it. Users should always be cautious if an offer seems too good; no one gives anything for free. Users should also be wary of YouTube accounts with many subscribers but suspiciously low activity and inconsistent content. Finally, having a good antivirus program installed on smart devices is essential. Therefore, continuous research and vigilance are necessary to protect potential victims and safely navigate the evolving cryptocurrency scene. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stay safe!\\n\\nIf this type of scam has compromised your accounts, do not hesitate to contact us and share your information and experiences. By doing so, you help improve protection against attackers and limit the reach of fraudsters.\\n\\nIoC\\n\\nCrypto Scam Wallets\\n\\nHijacked YouTube Accounts\\n\\nThe cc-yt-accounts list summarizes the most active YouTube accounts abused in CryptoCore campaigns, and the “Status” column describes each one’s state. It is a snapshot of August 7, 2024.\\n\\nThe “active” state indicates that the account contains artifacts typical for hijacking (background image, account name, etc.), but without scam videos. So, we cannot determine whether these accounts are still under the control of bad actors or have been returned to their original owners and have not been rolled back to their original state yet.\\n\\nReference\\n\\n[1] Twitter: Fake Elon Musk scam spreads after accounts hacked\\n\\n[2] Phishing campaign targets YouTube creators with cookie theft malware\\n\\n[3] Scammers hijack YouTube channels to promote Elon Musk-themed crypto schemes\\n\\n[4] Give and Take: An End-To-End Investigation of Giveaway Scam Conversion Rates\\n\\n[5] Technical analysis from one of the scam kits distributed on the dark web\\n\\n[6] Beware of scams!

In cooperation with law enforcement organizations, we have been silently providing the decryptor to DoNex ransomware victims since March 2024. The cryptographic weakness was made public at Recon 2024 and therefore we have no reason to keep this secret anymore.\\n\\nDoNex and its Brothers\\n\\nThe DoNex ransomware has been rebranded several times. The first brand, called Muse, appeared in April 2022. Multiple evolutions followed, resulting in the final version of the ransomware, called DoNex. Since April 2024, DoNex seems to have stopped its evolution, as we have not detected any new samples since. Additionally, the TOR site of the ransomware has been down since that point. The following is a brief history of DoNex.\\n\\nApr 2022 The first sample of Muse ransomware Nov 2022 Rebrand to fake LockBit 3.0 May 2023 Rebrand to DarkRace Mar 2024 Rebrand to DoNex\\n\\nAll brands of the DoNex ransomware are supported by the decryptor.\\n\\nDoNex uses targeted attacks on its victims and it was most active in the US, Italy, and the Netherlands based on our telemetry.\\n\\nDoNex blocked attacks\\n\\nRansomware Encryption Schema\\n\\nDuring the ransomware execution, an encryption key is generated by CryptGenRandom() function. This key is then used to initialize ChaCha20 symmetric key and subsequently to encrypt files. After a file is encrypted, the symmetric file key is encrypted by RSA-4096 and appended to the end of the file. The files are picked by their extension, and file extensions are listed in the ransomware XML config.\\n\\nFor small files (up to 1 MB), the entire file is encrypted. For files with size greater than 1 MB, intermittent encryption is used – the file is split into blocks and those blocks are encrypted separately.\\n\\nRansomware Configuration\\n\\nSamples of the DoNex ransomware, and its previous versions, contain XOR-encrypted configuration, which contains settings of whitelisted extensions, whitelisted files, services to kill, and other encryption-related data. The following snippet shows a part of such configuration:\\n\\n< root > < white_extens > 386;adv;ani;bat;bin;cab;cmd;com;cpl;cur;deskthemepack;diagcab;diagcfg; diagpkg;dll;drv;exe;hlp;icl;icns;ico;ics;idx;lnk;mod;mpa;msc;msp;msstyles; msu;nls;nomedia;ocx;prf;ps1;rom;rtp;scr;shs;spl;sys;theme;themepack;wpx; lock;key;hta;msi;pdb;search-ms </ white_extens > < white_files > bootmgr;autorun.inf;boot.ini;bootfont.bin;bootsect.bak;desktop.ini;iconcache.db; ntldr;ntuser.dat;ntuser.dat.log;ntuser.ini;thumbs.db;GDIPFONTCACHEV1.DAT;d3d9caps.dat </ white_files > < white_folders > $recycle.bin;config.msi;$windows.~bt;$windows.~ws;windows;boot;program files; program files (x86);programdata;system volume information;tor browser;windows.old; intel;msocache;perflogs;x64dbg;public;all users;default;microsoft;appdata </ white_folders > < kill_keep > sql;oracle;mysq;chrome;veeam;firefox;excel;msaccess;onenote;outlook;powerpnt;winword;wuauclt </ kill_keep > < services > vss;sql;svc$;memtas;mepocs;msexchange;sophos;veeam;backup;GxVss;GxBlr;GxFWD;GxCVD;GxCIMgr </ services > < black_db > ldf;mdf </ black_db > < encryption_thread > 30 </ encryption_thread > ... Code language: HTML, XML ( xml )\\n\\nHow do I know if I have been attacked by DoNex ransomware?\\n\\nThe simplest way to identify that you have been attacked by the DoNex ransomware is the ransom note. Different brands of the DoNex ransomware produce a different ransom note, but every version contains a note. That said, the ransom note layout of the Fake LockBit, DarkRace and DoNex ransomwares are very similar. Below you can see examples of each.\\n\\nScreenshot of the Muse ransom note\\n\\nScreenshot of the Fake LockBit ransom note\\n\\nScreenshot of the DarkRace ransom note\\n\\nScreenshot of the DoNex ransom note\\n\\nHow to use the DoNex ransomware decryptor\\n\\n1. Download the decryptor here.\\n\\n2. Run the executable file, preferably as an administrator. It starts as a wizard, leading you through the configuration of the decryption process.\\n\\n3. On the initial page, we have a link to the license information. Click the Next button when you are ready to start.\\n\\n4. On the next page, the user is asked to provide a list of locations (drives, folders, files) that are to be decrypted. By default, it has a list of all local disk drives.\\n\\n5. On the following page, you need to supply an example of a file in its original form and then one encrypted by any brand of the DoNex ransomware. Type both names of the files. You can also drag & drop files from Windows Explorer to the wizard page. It is extremely important to pick a pair of files that are as big as you can find. The largest file size that is decryptable by the tool equals to the file size of the encrypted file in the pair.\\n\\n6. The next page is where the password cracking process takes place. Click Start when you are ready to begin. This process usually only takes a second, but requires a large amount of system memory. This is why we strongly recommend using the 64-bit version of the decryption tool.\\n\\nOnce the password is found, you can continue to decrypt all the encrypted files on your PC by clicking Next.\\n\\n7. On the final page, you can opt-in to back up your encrypted files. These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This choice is selected by default, which we recommend. After clicking Decrypt the decryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes decrypting all of your files.\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)'),\n",

By tracking both source code and object code, we efficiently detect new malware and track the evolution of existing malware in-the-wild.\\n\\nDiamorphine is a well-known Linux kernel rootkit that supports different Linux kernel versions (2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x and 6.x) and processor architectures (x86, x86_64 and ARM64). Briefly stated, when loaded, the module becomes invisible and hides all the files and folders starting with the magic prefix chosen by the attacker at compilation time. After that, the threat actor can interact with Diamorphine by sending signals allowing the following operations: hide/unhide arbitrary processes, hide/unhide the kernel module, and elevate privileges to become root.\\n\\nIn early March 2024, we found a new Diamorphine variant undetected in-the-wild. After obtaining the sample, I examined the .modinfo section and noticed that it fakes the legitimate x_tables Netfilter module and was compiled for a specific kernel version (Kernel 5.19.17).\\n\\nBy listing the functions with Radare2, we can notice that the sample under analysis consisted of Diamorphine kernel rootkit (i.ex. module_hide, hacked_kill, get_syscall_table_bf, find_task, is_invisible, and module_show). But we can see also additional functions in the module (a, b, c, d, e, f, and setup) indicating that the sample was weaponized with more payloads.\\n\\nSince Diamorphine is a well-known and open-source Linux kernel rootkit, this blog post is focused on the new features that were implemented:\\n\\nStop Diamorphine by sending a message to the exposed device: xx_tables.\\n\\nExecute arbitrary operating system commands via magic packets.\\n\\nInserting the kernel rootkit\\n\\nTo insert this Diamorphine variant, we need a Linux operating system with the kernel version 5.19.17. We can find the appropriate Linux distro by using Radare2 too. Based on the compiler, we can see that Ubuntu 22.04 is a good candidate for this.\\n\\nIn fact, I found a person on Internet who used Ubuntu Jammy for this, and the version of the symbols of this specific Diamorphine source code partially matches the version of the symbols of the new Diamorphine variant that we found in VirusTotal (i.ex. module_layout don’t matches the version, but unregister_kprobe matches it).\\n\\nTherefore, the kernel rootkit can be inserted in an Ubuntu Jammy distro having the appropriate version of the symbols (see the Module.symvers file of the kernel where the Diamorphine variant will be inserted into).\\n\\nXX_Tables: The device that the rootkit creates for user mode to kernel mode communication\\n\\nImpersonating the X_Tables module of Netfiler is a clever idea because, this way, registering Netfilter hooks doesn’t raise suspicions, since interacting with Netfilter is an expected behaviour.\\n\\nAt the init_module function, the rootkit creates a device named xx_tables for communicating user mode space with the kernel mode rootkit.\\n\\nFollowing the everything is a file idea, the character device structure initialization function receives the file operations structure exposing the operations implemented and handled by the xx_tables device. The “g” function that appears in the file_operations structure is responsible for handling the dev_write operation.\\n\\nHandling the dev_write operation: The “g” function.\\n\\nWe can see that the function reads the commands from user mode space via xx_tables device. The memory is copied from the device using the API _copy_from_user.\\n\\nFor safety reasons, the rootkit checks that the data sent from user mode space is not empty. Such data structure contains two fields: The length of the data, and a pointer to the data itself.\\n\\nFinally, if the input sent from user mode space is the string “exit“, it calls to the exit_ function of the rootkit which restores the system, frees the resources and unloads the kernel module from memory.\\n\\nThe exit_ function\\n\\nThe exit_ function properly restores the system and unloads the rootkit from the kernel memory. It performs the following actions:\\n\\nIt destroys the device created by the rootkit. It destroys the struct class that was used for creating the device. Deletes the cdev (character device) that was created. Unregisters the chrdev_region. Unregisters the Netfilter hooks implementing the “magic packets“. Finally, it replaces the pointers with the original functions in the system_calls table.\\n\\nThe magic packets\\n\\nThe new Diamorphine rootkit implements “magic packets” supporting both: IPv4 and IPv6. Since the Protocol Family is set to NFPROTO_INET).\\n\\nThe netfilter_hook_function relies in nested calls to a, b, c, d, e and f, functions for handling the magic packets. The magic packet requirements include containing the values “whitehat” and “2023_mn” encrypted with the XOR key: 0x64.\\n\\nIf the packet fits the requirements the arbitrary command is extracted from it and executed into the infected computer.\\n\\nThe hooks in the syscalls table\\n\\nThis is the original Diamorphine rootkit implementation of the syscalls hooking:\\n\\nEven if the code is exactly the same in the new Diamorphine variant, it is important to highlight that it is configured to hide the files and folders containing the string: “…”.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nWe frequently discover new Linux kernel rootkits implementing magic packets that are undetected in-the-wild (i.ex. Syslogk, AntiUnhide, Chicken, etc.) and will continue collaborating and working together for providing the highest level of protection to our customers.\\n\\nIn this new in-the-wild version of Diamorphine, the threat actors added the device functionality allowing to unload the rootkit kernel module from memory and the magic packets functionality enabling the arbitrary commands execution in the infected system.\\n\\nHow to prevent infection and stay safe online\\n\\nKeep your systems up to date.\\n\\nBe sure that your Internet connection is safe to use (i.ex. Virtual Private Network).\\n\\nAvoid downloading/executing files from untrusted sources.\\n\\nExercise the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). In the case of Linux, please, do not execute actions making use of the root account if it is not strictly necessary.\\n\\nUse a strong cyber safety solution such as Norton, Avast, Avira or AVG to make sure you are protected against these types of malwares.\\n\\nNew Diamorphine variant\\n\\n067194bb1a70e9a3d18a6e4252e9a9c881ace13a6a3b741e9f0ec299451c2090\\n\\nIoC repository\\n\\nThe Diamorphine Linux kernel rootkit IoCs, the Yara hunting rule and the VirusTotal query are in our IoC repository.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'title': 'Avast Q1/2024 Threat Report', 'link': 'https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/avast-q1-2024-threat-report/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=avast-q1-2024-threat-report', 'authors': ['Threat Research Team'], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'Nearly 90% of Threats Blocked are Social Engineering, Revealing a Huge Surge of Scams, and Discovery of the Lazarus APT Campaign', 'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 14, 7, 0, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'feed': 'https://decoded.avast.io/feed/'}, page_content='Nearly 90% of Threats Blocked are Social Engineering, Revealing a Huge Surge of Scams, and Discovery of the Lazarus APT Campaign\\n\\nForeword\\n\\nWe’re pleased to present the latest edition of our report for the first quarter of 2024, which has been nothing short of eventful. Here are some highlights.\\n\\nNot all heroes wear capes. Just a few weeks ago, developer Andres Freund disrupted a covert threat operation that had been running for over two years. The threat actors, who managed to insert a backdoor into the widely used open-source compression library XZ/liblzma, were stopped just in time by Andres. While the identity of the threat actors remains unknown, the potential ramifications of their actions could have been catastrophic – they were almost able to gain access to any Linux machine running an infected distribution. This incident has raised important questions about the security of open-source code and its integration into critical systems and applications.\\n\\nSocial engineering attacks continue to be the largest threat across platforms and continue to increase their share of threats. In the mobile device landscape, more than 90% of all threats blocked in the last quarter originated from scams and similar threat types. This trend is mirrored on desktop platforms, with 87% of threats falling into the same categories. Scams, in particular, have seen a significant surge (61% on mobile and 23% on desktop), fueled by malvertising and the proliferation of malicious push notifications. The risk of falling victim to these attacks has nearly doubled in certain regions, such as Ukraine, highlighting the global reach and impact of these malicious activities. Moreover, scam authors are deploying increasingly sophisticated tactics, including the use of deepfake technology, AI-manipulated audio synchronization, and the hijacking of popular YouTube channels to disseminate fraudulent content, amplifying the potential for financial harm.\\n\\nDating scams also continue to surge, particularly in North America and Europe, with Central Europe emerging as a hotspot for such activity. Phishing remains a persistent threat, steadily increasing over the past six quarters. Prevalent phishing campaigns are detailed further in this report.\\n\\nOn the desktop front, we’ve uncovered a sophisticated APT campaign orchestrated by the Lazarus Group, targeting individuals in Asia with deceptive job offers. Furthermore, we discovered and reported to Microsoft an in-the-wild exploit within a Windows driver, subsequently utilized by a sophisticated rootkit in this campaign. Additionally, botnet activity has been a cause for concern – with notable updates observed in the Twizt botnet which now includes brute-forcing capabilities for Server Message Block (SMB) protocol credentials – and the expansion of the malicious DDosia project. Interestingly, the DDosia project faced frequent downtimes due to countermeasures taken by unidentified individuals. Furthermore, we successfully assisted Ukrainian CERT with the remediation of the DirtyMoe botnet.\\n\\nThe prevalence of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) stealers, exemplified by DarkGate and Luma, remains a significant threat. These malicious actors capitalize on every opportunity to deploy social engineering tactics to distribute malware.\\n\\nRansomware incidents also experienced a slight uptick in Q1/2024, notably marked by the LockBit ransomware making headlines for its initial takedown by law enforcement units, only to resurface shortly after. Furthermore, our researchers identified a new ransomware strain named HomuWitch and promptly responded by developing decryption tools to assist affected individuals. This effort supplements our previous creation, the Rhysida decryption tool, which continues to aid victims of Rhysida in recovering their files.\\n\\nIn the realm of remote access trojans (RATs), law enforcement units have successfully executed operations against notorious threats like the Warzone RAT, resulting in several arrests. This decisive action has already yielded tangible results, as evidenced by our telemetry data.\\n\\nOn the mobile front, we’ve witnessed several intriguing developments, including the resurgence of adware on the PlayStore, the emergence of MoqHao, a banker strain capable of auto-starting on victim devices, and the proliferation of GoldPickaxe, which attempts to steal facial recognition biometrics for fraudulent activities. Additionally, state-sponsored spyware continues to pose a threat to citizens.\\n\\nThank you for your continued trust in Avast. Stay safe and secure.\\n\\nJakub Křoustek, Malware Research Director\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nThis report is structured into two main sections: Desktop-related threats, where we describe our intelligence around attacks targeting the Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems, with a specific emphasis on web-related threats, and Mobile-related threats, where we describe the attacks focusing on Android and iOS operating systems.\\n\\nWe use the term “risk ratio” in this report to denote the severity of specific threats. This is calculated as a monthly average of “Number of attacked users / Number of active users in a given country.” Unless stated otherwise, calculated risks are only available for countries with more than 10,000 active users per month.\\n\\nA blocked attack is defined as a unique combination of the protected user and a blocked threat identifier within the specified time frame.\\n\\nFeatured Story: YouTube – the New Battleground for Phishing, Malvertising, and Cryptoscams\\n\\nYouTube, with its 2.5 billion users, has become a trusted and significant target for malvertising. The combination of automated advertising systems and user-generated content provides a gateway for cybercriminals to bypass conventional security measures, making YouTube a potent channel for deploying phishing and malware. Notable threats on the platform include credential stealers like Lumma and Redline, phishing and scam landing pages, and malicious software disguised as legitimate software or updates. Additionally, YouTube serves as a conduit to Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS), directing users to malicious sites and supporting scams ranging from fake giveaways to investment schemes.\\n\\nOur web scanning endpoints actively block thousands of HTTP requests, daily, that are redirected from YouTube as our users view content. This activity reflects a worrying trend:\\n\\n4 millions unique users were protected against threats on YouTube in 2023\\n\\nunique users were protected against threats on YouTube in 2023 Approx 500k unique users per month protected in Q1/2024\\n\\nThe rise of DeepFake videos in YouTube poses significant risks by realistically mimicking people or events, misleading viewers, and spreading disinformation. In Q1 we observed multiple compromised YouTube accounts with more than 50 million subscribers hijacked to spread Cryptoscam Deefake videos (more about this topic is described below in the Scam section).\\n\\nThreat actors frequently utilize automated uploads and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning to enhance the visibility of harmful content. Additionally, fake comments are rampant, deceiving viewers, promoting dangerous links, and exploiting YouTube’s algorithms and user engagement to disseminate cyber threats.\\n\\nThere are numbers of ways in which YouTube can be exploited to disseminate threats. Observed basic Tactics and Procedures (TTP) on YouTube include:\\n\\nPhishing Campaigns Targeting Creators: Attackers send personalized emails to YouTube creators proposing fraudulent collaboration opportunities. Once trust is established, they send links to malware under the guise of software needed for collaboration, often leading to cookie theft or account compromise. Compromised Video Descriptions: Attackers upload videos with descriptions containing malicious links, masquerading as legitimate software downloads related to gaming, productivity tools, or even antivirus programs, tricking users into downloading malware Channel Hijacking for Spreading Threats: By gaining control of YouTube channels through phishing or malware, attackers repurpose these channels to promote various types of threats, such as cryptocurrency scams, often involving fake giveaways that require an initial deposit from viewers. Exploitation of Software Brands and Legitimate-Looking Domains: Attackers create websites that mimic reputable companies and offer illegitimate downloadable software, exploiting users’ trust. Social Engineering via Video Content: Attackers post tutorial videos or offers for cracked software, guiding users to download malware disguised as helpful tools. This tactic takes advantage of users seeking free access to otherwise paid services or software, leveraging YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms to target potential victims.\\n\\nMichael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, in deep fake crypto scam video\\n\\nDavid Jursa, Malware Researcher\\n\\nLuis Corrons, Security Evangelist\\n\\nDesktop-Related Threats\\n\\nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Lazarus Group in the Spotlight\\n\\nAn Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of cyberattack that is conducted by highly skilled and determined hackers who have the resources and expertise to penetrate a target’s network and maintain a long-term presence undetected.\\n\\nWe discovered a Lazarus Group campaign targeting specific individuals in Asia with misleading job offers. The precise intent of the campaign remains unknown, but the selective nature of these attacks indicates a focused interest in individuals possessing technical expertise. We suspect that these technically skilled individuals might have connections to companies involved in the gambling or betting industry, aligning with Lazarus Group’s financial motivations.\\n\\nWe believe the Lazarus Group used fabricated job offers to gain access to the personal computers of these victims who also used these devices for work purposes. It is likely that, a few days after the initial compromise, the attackers realized the victims had access to their company networks. Consequently, Lazarus employed sophisticated rootkit technologies to evade security measures and some security vendors.\\n\\nThis approach reflects the Lazarus Group’s historical tactics of exploiting vulnerable drivers and employing advanced rootkit techniques to disrupt security systems and maintain persistent access.\\n\\nIn this specific instance, Lazarus exploited a vulnerability in the standard Windows driver, appid.sys (CVE-2024-21338), to neutralize security software. Further details on this vulnerability can be found in our related blog post.\\n\\nThe complexity of these attack chains suggests that Lazarus devoted substantial resources to their planning and execution. Before executing the attack, Lazarus carefully prepared by deploying fileless malware and encrypting their tools directly onto the hard drives, as detailed in the blog post and as we recently presented at Black Hat Asia 2024 conference.\\n\\nCommunication of the Lazarus Group’s toolkit with C&C servers\\n\\nThe careful and highly targeted choice of victims suggests that establishing some level of trust or connection was likely necessary before initiating the malware. The deployment of such a sophisticated arsenal, coupled with the exploit, highlights significant strategic foresight and resource commitment.\\n\\nLuigino Camastra, Malware Researcher\\n\\nIgor Morgenstern, Malware Researcher\\n\\nBots (With a Twist)\\n\\nBots are threats mainly interested in securing long-term access to devices with the aim of utilizing their resources, be it remote control, spam distribution, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\\n\\nTo start on a lighter note, the biggest news in the botnet landscape was an unfortunate article in Swiss media outlet Aarguaer Zeitung which claimed a large-scale DDoS attack of millions of toothbrushes running Java. While the thought of a web-connected toothbrush running Java (which were also allegedly DDosing some random Swiss webpage) is really scary, it has been soon rectified as an inaccurate report and there was no such army of Pro-Russian toothbrushes, as the initial report suggested.\\n\\nNow, unfortunately, onto the more serious note. On the geopolitical side of the threat landscape, Ukrainian state-owned enterprises have been significantly hit with DirtMoe. Due to our extensive research on DirtMoe, CERT-UA reached out to us to assist them with the remediation. Based on the experience from this successful remediation, an advisory on DirtyMoe was published by CERT-UA.\\n\\nTwizt botnet has received a new module in its update providing functionality that fuels its sextortion campaign. This module relies on the common strategy of extorting the user with fake and sensitive information that was allegedly recovered from their device or account. In the case of the former, the threat actor usually refers to a device infected with RAT, in the case of the latter, the message usually contains a fake sender header and a password to give the impression that the user’s mail account has been hacked. Nevertheless, all the sent information is fabricated, and the password was quite likely taken from one of the leaked password databases that are circulating the dark web.\\n\\nSextortion email referencing infected device\\n\\nSextortion email containing a password and a reference to RAT\\n\\nLast year, Twizt started bruteforcing Virtual Network Computing (VNC) credentials. At the beginning of the year, they switched to brute-forcing SMB credentials, instead. Twizt contains a hard-coded list of username/password pairs that are tried against a randomly generated target. Successful authentications are then reported to its command-and-control (C&C) server.\\n\\nOur usual story on DDosia has a very surprising twist this quarter. Presumably, someone was actively targeting the DDosia C&C infrastructure, repeatedly causing outages in the proxy servers fronting real C&C servers. This resulted in rapid infrastructure changes in this outer layer, with every new proxy C&C having an approximate lifetime of 2 days before being unavailable again. Due to the absence of a client update mechanism in case of C&C outage, this forced the project owners to produce new clients every few days. Later, they started distributing new clients exclusively via private messages, presumably to reduce information exposure.\\n\\nBreakdown of top-level domains targeted by DDosia\\n\\nTargets published on DDosia’s Telegram group\\n\\nThe requirement to manually update DDosia’s binary with each update along with frequent C&C outages resulted in a significant decrease in the impact of their attacks. This has prompted a heated backlash on the project’s Telegram channel where “patriotic activists” started complaining that these issues are seriously impacting their cash-flow.\\n\\nThis was particularly notable around February 19 when eight proxy C&Cs were shut down for five days. Even after this date, they were not able to return to their previous efficacy. The only peak during Q1/2024 is an attack at the end of March when DDosia targeted services associated with the Luxembourg government. While the number of successful targets seems to be rather high, it targeted infrastructure that was hosted on only 3 IP addresses with many subdomains. These turbulent changes were crowned by a move to a different Telegram group called “DDoSia Project” on March 7 with the original group being removed. While, up to that date, the original group was growing, ending with approximately 20,000 members, the new group started up with only around 12,000 members and soon continued in this downward trend.\\n\\nDDosia Telegram group members\\n\\nWhile in the previous quarter DDosia was mostly focusing on banks, during the first quarter of 2024 DDosia focused mostly on various industry consortia, courts, press agencies, CERTs, and transport and logistic companies. The underlying logic stayed mostly the same – finding targets within countries that went against Russian interests.\\n\\nAs for the trends in the whole botnet landscape, many of the prevalent strains have stagnated. Still, we’ve seen several bigger shifts in their prevalence, including increased activity of BetaBot (13%). On the other hand, most of the other strains seem to be in decline with the following strains seeing the biggest drops: Pikabot (-48%), Tofsee (-31%), MyKings (-21%), and Dridex (-21%).\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio of bots in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nAdolf Středa, Malware Researcher\\n\\nCoinminers Continue to Decline\\n\\nCoinminers are programs that use a device’s hardware resources to verify cryptocurrency transactions and earn cryptocurrency as compensation. However, in the world of malware, coinminers silently hijack a victim’s computer resources to generate cryptocurrency for an attacker. Regardless of whether a coinminer is legitimate or malware, it’s important to follow our guidelines.\\n\\nIn the previous quarter, we observed a continued decline in the prevalence of coinminers. This downward trend persisted into Q1/2024, where the risk ratio decreased by a substantial 28%. This decrease was influenced by a slight reduction in the coinminer malware share of XMRig, which had surged in the previous quarter. However, nearly all other major coinminers actually increased in activity, thereby expanding their share.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for coinminers in Q1/2024\\n\\nAfter the surge in the USA and Turkey the previous quarter, the situation calmed down a bit and we observed 39% decrease in risk ratio both countries. According to our data, more significant declines happened in India (22%), Egypt (19%), and Pakistan (13%). In total, the biggest risk of getting infected by a coinminers is still in Madagascar (2.18% risk ratio), Turkey (1.47%), Pakistan (1.35%), and Egypt (1.14%).\\n\\nIn the graph below, we can observe a steady decline in coinmining activities.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio in our user base regarding coinminers in Q1/2024\\n\\nXMRig, the long-time most popular coinminer, decreased in coinminer malware share by 6% this quarter. Yet, it still holds 60% of the total share. All other major coinminers saw an increase in their activity, including web miners (5% increase), CoinBitMiner (24%), FakeKMSminer (37%), among others. On the other hand, SilentCryptoMiner lost 58% share this quarter.\\n\\nThe most common coinminers with their malware share in Q1/2024 were:\\n\\nXMRig (59.53%)\\n\\nWeb miners (20.20%)\\n\\nCoinBitMiner (2.67%)\\n\\nFakeKMSminer (2.03%)\\n\\nNeoScrypt (1.75%)\\n\\nCoinHelper (1.05%)\\n\\nVMiner (0.86%)\\n\\nSilentCryptoMiner (0.84%)\\n\\nJan Rubín, Malware Researcher\\n\\nInformation Stealers are Still Dominated by AgentTesla\\n\\nInformation stealers are dedicated to stealing anything of value from the victim’s device. Typically, they focus on stored credentials, cryptocurrencies, browser sessions/cookies, browser passwords and private documents.\\n\\nAgentTesla, traditionally the most prevalent information stealer we protect our users against, continued to attack users by leveraging email campaigns. One such campaign targeted Czechia, spreading the stealer via malicious attachments.\\n\\nEmail containing AgentTesla in attachments (AvastThreatLabs)\\n\\nTimbreStealer, targeting almost explicitly users in Mexico, is a newcomer in the information stealers landscape. The malware is quite advanced and multi-modular, containing techniques like Heaven’s gate, among many others. It also introduces many tricks for preventing execution in sandboxes and proper debugging.\\n\\nMalware-as-a-Service (MaaS) stealers continue to thrive, finding new distribution methods whenever possible. For example, DarkGate was observed to be spread via Microsoft Teams, using phishing. Furthermore, from the more technical perspective, DarkGate was exploiting Microsoft Windows SmartScreen (CVE-2024-21412).\\n\\nWe have also observed a DarkGate campaign distributed via malicious PDF files, abusing crypto exchange and the WebDAV server. The malware delivery was done using an InternetShortcut link (.URL file), downloading the content from an opendir.\\n\\nPDF leading to DarkGate deployment (AvastThreatLabs)\\n\\nOn the other hand, Lumma Stealer, which is yet another MaaS stealer, continues to spread via cracked software propagated on YouTube, using fake tutorials to mislead victims. This further emphasizes that such strains – and their creators – never miss an opportunity to leverage social engineering to distribute malware.\\n\\nWith regards to macOS, AtomicStealer, also known as AMOS, saw a consistent rise in occurrences on this platform during Q1/2024. This typically obfuscated malware is known for stealing passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and cookies. It often infiltrates systems via counterfeit applications or through Google Ads poisoning. The existence of multiple generations of this threat suggests that it is likely to persist in the future, which is further underlined by its new version that was carried by a malvertising campaign in the beginning of the year.\\n\\nIn terms of Linux, Python information stealers were the more prevalent strains of this type with well-known malware families like Spidey, Creal, Wasp or PirateStealer. Additionally, in this quarter we uncovered a new malware strain identified as PassSniff/Putin and written in C++ that, instead of stealing the passwords from disk, steals the passwords by sniffing the HTTP traffic using both, generic rules and specific rules targeting popular services and applications.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nOverall, the global risk ratio decreased by 8% in Q1/2024 for information stealers. However, many popular stealers further increased their reach, including AgentTesla, Stealc, Fareit, and ViperSoftX.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio in our user base regarding information stealers in Q1/2024\\n\\nEach of the countries where we observe the risk ratio with regards to information stealers and where we have more significant userbase thankfully experienced a decrease in activity compared to the previous quarter:\\n\\nTurkey (2.29%) with 23% Q/Q decrease\\n\\nPakistan (2.05%) with 11% Q/Q decrease\\n\\nEgypt (1.78%) with 10% Q/Q decrease\\n\\nOn the other hand, we also measured increases in activity in Mexico and Czechia, following the aforementioned TimbreStealer and AgentTesla campaigns, were the risk ratio increased by 25% and 14%, respectively.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for information stealers in Q1/2024\\n\\nAgentTesla, the most prevalent information stealer according to our data, has increased its malware share by 17%. Its campaigns primarily target Central Europe and both North and South America. As a result, it now holds a significant 30.31% of the malware share. Notably, almost every bigger information stealer experienced an increase in activity, including Fareit (34% increase), Stealc (33%), ViperSoftX (28%), and Azorult (14%). FormBook’s share decreased by 32%, as well as Lokibot’s by 50%, balancing the scales of the overall activity of information stealers.\\n\\nThe most common information stealers with their malware shares in Q1/2024 were:\\n\\nAgentTesla (30.31%)\\n\\nFareit (7.55%)\\n\\nFormBook (6.92%)\\n\\nRedLine (4.37%)\\n\\nStealc (2.81%)\\n\\nViperSoftX (2.28%)\\n\\nAzorult (1.93%)\\n\\nClipBanker (1.72%)\\n\\nRaccoon (1.56%)\\n\\nLokibot (1.41%)\\n\\nRhadamanthys (1.36%)\\n\\nJan Rubín, Malware Researcher\\n\\nDavid Álvarez, Malware Analyst\\n\\nRansomware: Fighting it Back\\n\\nRansomware is any type of extorting malware. The most common subtype is the one that encrypts documents, photos, videos, databases, and other files on the victim’s PC. Those files become unusable without decrypting them first. To decrypt the files, attackers demand money, “ransom”, hence the term ransomware.\\n\\nThe LockBit Story\\n\\nIn the previous threat report, we discussed new ransomware attacks. One of the top ransomware strains (or gangs, if you wish) is LockBit, which continues its encryption and extortion attacks with an undiminished intensity.\\n\\nBecause of the notoriety of LockBit, their – albeit brief – takedown in Q1/2024 was watched closely by the public. On February 19, operation Cronos was announced, which was a joint operation between law enforcement agencies in 10 countries. As a part of this operation, the FBI successfully breached the LockBit infrastructure, secured about 1000 private encryption keys and released a public decryptor. The following is the timeline surrounding the initiative:\\n\\nFeb 19: Operation Cronos was unveiled. LockBit leak site was replaced by a landing page from the associated law enforcement agencies:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe main panel was replaced with a version augmented by the authorities, outing the criminality of ransomware operators:\\n\\nFeb 20 : Two LockBit operators (Poland and Ukraine) were arrested, and a few other individuals were indicted for their involvement in LockBit operations\\n\\n: Two LockBit operators (Poland and Ukraine) were arrested, and a few other individuals were indicted for their involvement in LockBit operations LockBit informed all their affiliates about the breach\\n\\nFor four days, there was no information about new victims of the LockBit ransomware\\n\\nFeb 24 : A long message from LockBit was published by DarkWebInformer. This message explained what happened and questioned the law enforcement agencies’ success. The author of the message explains that some of his servers were running an outdated version of PHP and hence were vulnerable to CVE-2023-3824.\\n\\n: A long message from LockBit was published by DarkWebInformer. This message explained what happened and questioned the law enforcement agencies’ success. The author of the message explains that some of his servers were running an outdated version of PHP and hence were vulnerable to CVE-2023-3824. Feb 25: The LockBit leak site was restored, with the FBI now shown as one of the victims. Additionally, the information about leaked data from Fulton County was re-uploaded. Note that the Fulton County Government was allegedly attacked by LockBit on Feb 14 and the leaked data was mentioned in LockBit’s message as the reason that the FBI stopped the operation instead of silently watching the servers and exfiltrating LockBit’s data increasingly, as their criminal activities continued.\\n\\n\\n\\nFeb 26: LockBit operators restored their cyber-attacks and re-started attacking multiple companies daily. No, this is not a story with a happy conclusion (so far).\\n\\nA tool for decrypting LockBit-encrypted data using one of 1000 seized encryption keys is. The importance of these encryption keys has been questioned by the LockBit operator himself, saying (quote) “Note that the vast majority of unprotected decryptors are from partners who encrypt brute force dedicas and spam single computers, taking $2000 ransoms” (end quote). Users attacked by LockBit ransomware may use the tool to verify if their data can be decrypted using one of the keys that were seized during the Cronos operation.\\n\\nAnother LockBit-related incident happened at the beginning of 2024, which demonstrates some of the ransomware operators’ modus operandi. After LockBitSupp gained access to an unspecified company, encrypted their data, and received ransom payout, he that provided access to the network.\\n\\nThis little incident shows what ransomware operators do to penetrate a company:\\n\\nRansomware operator “buys an access” which means obtaining information about a company, its vulnerabilities and how to breach its network. Then the operator maps the company network and eventually deploys the ransomware. When the attacked company pays the ransom, the “access seller” gets paid for the access.\\n\\nRansomware Decryptors\\n\\nAs a part of the ongoing battle against ransomware, Avast released two ransomware decryptors: HomuWitch and Rhysida.\\n\\nHomuWitch\\n\\nHomuWitch is a ransomware that stayed under the radar since July 2023, because it targets end users with smaller ransom demands (25 – 75 USD). Searching for pirated software is the most common infection vector – instead of the desired software, users may download SmokeLoader backdoor, which later installs malicious dropper for the ransomware payload.\\n\\nUnlike most ransomware strains that perform file encryption, HomuWitch also adds compression, so the encrypted files are smaller than their originals. When executed, HomuWitch searches local drives and user folders (Pictures, Downloads, Documents). All files of interest (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .py, .rar, .zip, .7z, .txt, .mp4, .JPG, .PNG, .HEIC, .csv) are encrypted and renamed to the .homuencrypted extension:\\n\\nWhile analyzing this ransomware, we found a vulnerability that allows affected users to recover their files for free. We released free decryptor that is available on our website.\\n\\nRhysida\\n\\nRhysida is another ransomware strain defeated by the free decryption tool. This ransomware has been active since May 2023 and focuses on the enterprise sector. During summer, we discovered that this ransomware strain is decryptable without having the private RSA key, so we have been helping people who were attacked by the Rhysida ransomware.\\n\\nIn February 2024, Korean researchers also discovered that vulnerability and released their decryption tool publicly. It is always unfortunate to publish detailed information about the details of a vulnerability – we would like to ask fellow malware researchers not to do so and focus more on helping people affected by ransomware attacks.\\n\\nNow that the details of the vulnerability are public, we also released a free decryption tool that is available both on our website and as part of the NoMoreRansom project.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nThe most prevalent ransomware strains that we block in our userbase are listed below. As opposed to more popular threats like LockBit, Akira or BlackCat, you rarely read about those strains in media because – instead of attacking a large company and demanding millions of USD as ransom – these strains focus on either individual users or small businesses, and they demand ransoms that are in the thousands of dollars range.\\n\\nWannaCry (21% of ransomware share)\\n\\nEnigma (12%)\\n\\nSTOP (12%)\\n\\nMallox (aka TargetCompany) (3%)\\n\\nDarkSide (2%)\\n\\nCryptonite (1%)\\n\\nThe overall ransomware risk ratio in our user base is showing an increase when compared to the previous quarter. The situation started escalating in March 2024:\\n\\nThe ransomware risk ratio per country is depicted on the following map. We have noticed a significant increase in Bulgaria, Japan, Czechia, and Hungary where the risk ratio more than doubled Q/Q.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for ransomware in Q1/2024\\n\\nLadislav Zezula, Malware Researcher\\n\\nJakub Křoustek, Malware Research Director\\n\\nRemote Access Trojans (RATs): The End of Warzone\\n\\nA Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malicious software that allows unauthorized individuals to gain remote control over a victim’s computer or device. RATs are typically spread through social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails or infected file downloads. Once installed, RATs grant the attacker complete access to the victim’s device, enabling them to execute various malicious activities, such as spying, data theft, remote surveillance, and even taking control of the victim’s webcam and microphone.\\n\\nSimilarly to Q1/2023 and the Netwire takedown, this year also begins with a takedown action against one of the major players in the RAT scene – the Warzone RAT was taken down at the beginning of February. According to our data, the effect was immediately visible as a sudden drop in the number of detected attacks by Warzone. Besides this takedown, it was a rather slow start to the year with only a few notable events in the RAT sphere.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio in our user base regarding RATs in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nCompared to Q4/2023, the global risk ratio in the first quarter of 2024 is following a downward trend. There are several reasons for this decline. The big players Remcos, njRAT, and AsyncRat seem to have eased off a little and the number of attacks in Q1/2024 was lower than what we typically see. The takedown action against Warzone might have caused some RAT operators to halt or pause their activities. While we see increased activity of less prevalent malware strains, this isn’t enough to compensate the overall attack numbers.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for RATs in Q1/2024\\n\\nThe top 3 countries and RATs have not changed. We still see the highest risk ratio in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen, with HWorm and njRAT as the most active threats there.\\n\\nThe biggest increase in risk ratio was observed in Canada (+69%) due to increased activity of XWorm in February. This led to XWorm increasing its malware share by 378% which makes it the most prevalent RAT in Canada. The second highest share is in New Zealand (+33%) followed by Switzerland (+14%). Remcos was the dominant force in both countries. Despite this rise of risk ratio, Switzerland is still among the safest countries regarding RAT attacks.\\n\\nThe most prevalent remote access trojan strains in our userbase are as follows:\\n\\nHWorm\\n\\nRemcos\\n\\nnjRAT\\n\\nAsyncRat\\n\\nQuasarRAT\\n\\nWarzone\\n\\nFlawedAmmyy\\n\\nXWorm\\n\\nNanoCore\\n\\nDarkComet\\n\\nAlthough the overall number of detected attacks by Remcos slightly dropped, it is still very active. We recently warned about a campaign targeting most of Eastern Europe; this campaign was created in the Russian language and used a common lure “Invoice payment confirmation”.\\n\\nWe already mentioned XWorm in relation to Canada, however it also managed to increase its presence in most parts of the world. We also see XWorm frequently releasing new versions.\\n\\nOn February 7, an international operation targeted the Warzone RAT resulting in the seizure of four domains, including the primary site “warzone.ws”, and server infrastructure. One suspect was arrested in Malta and another in Nigeria. The FBI led the operation with assistance from Europol, the U.S. Department of Justice, and local law enforcement agencies. The suspects are accused of selling and advertising the RAT, providing support, and unauthorized damage to protected computers.\\n\\nDomain warzone.ws taken down by the authorities\\n\\nFortiGuard Labs also uncovered a phishing campaign spreading a new RAT, VCURMS. The campaign uses a downloader with payloads stored on public services like AWS and GitHub. There are two known payloads – the new VCURMS and STRRAT. STRRAT is also a remote access trojan which appeared in 2020. The interesting part of VCURMS is its unusual command and control channel. It communicates using emails with a Proton Mail address. Like STRRAT, VCURMS is also coded in Java. Another notable feature is its infostealer module which looks similar to RudeStealer.\\n\\nPhylum and Sonatype discovered another supply chain attack in Q1/2024. Both teams found malicious packages in PyPI. These packages deploy a RAT that can also steal information from infected machines. Phylum named this threat “poweRAT”, because it relies on PowerShell in the early stages. Both reports mention the following packages as affected: pyrologin, easytimestamp, discorder, discord-dev, style.py and pythonstyles. Sonatype followed up on this story, adding several more packages to the list and showing how this threat has evolved. Communication with the C&C server happens via a Cloudflare Tunnel created from the infected machine, which means the malware does not need to modify any firewall settings. The features of RAT and information-stealing components are common on their own – however, when they combine, they create quite a dangerous threat. Phylum refers to it as a “RAT on steroids” and Sonatype as “RAT mutant”.\\n\\nOndřej Mokoš, Malware Researcher\\n\\nVulnerabilities and Exploits: An Actively Exploited Admin-to-Kernel Zero-Day\\n\\nExploits take advantage of flaws in legitimate software to perform actions that should not be allowed. They are typically categorized into remote code execution (RCE) exploits, which allow attackers to infect another machine, and local privilege escalation (LPE) exploits, which allow attackers to take more control of a partially infected machine.\\n\\nIn the February Patch Tuesday update, Microsoft patched CVE-2024-21338, a zero-day admin-to-kernel vulnerability discovered by Avast researchers. This zero-day was initially exploited in the wild by the Lazarus Group, who used it to enable an updated version of their FudModule data-only rootkit. This marked a significant improvement in capabilities, as previous versions of the FudModule rootkit were enabled by targeting known vulnerable drivers for BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks.\\n\\nUpgrading from BYOVD techniques to a zero-day in a built-in driver made the entire attack significantly stealthier, however, this wasn’t the only upgrade. Lazarus also revamped the rootkit functionality, targeting registry callbacks, object callbacks, process/thread/image callbacks, file system minifilters, Windows Filtering Platform, Event Tracing for Windows, and image verification callbacks. Additionally, the threat actors implemented a noteworthy handle table entry manipulation technique, attempting to suspend critical processes associated with Microsoft Defender, CrowdStrike Falcon, and HitmanPro. For a deeper understanding of this attack, we recommend reading our two technical blog posts or watching our Black Hat Asia 2024 talk.\\n\\nThe decompiled “main” function of the FudModule rootkit, executing the exploit and all the individual rootkit techniques.\\n\\nIn other news, the open-source world was shocked by the discovery of a backdoor in the xz/liblzma compression library. This backdoor was discovered by software engineer Andres Freund, who noticed that failing ssh logins were consuming suspicious amounts of CPU, and did the world a huge favor by deciding to investigate the root cause. The attacker(s) went by the name Jia Tan (their exact affiliation/motivation remain unclear) and demonstrated a remarkable level of patience, slowly building up trust by contributing to the open-source project for over two years. Eventually, they decided to strike and – over a number of commits – introduced the backdoor, the ultimate goal of which was to allow remote SSH logins to those with the possession of the right private key (CVE-2024-3094).\\n\\nFortunately, the backdoor was discovered relatively early, so the attackers didn’t have enough time to get the malicious code merged into major Linux distributions like Debian or Red Hat. This was a close call, however, which should be very alarming, as this could have easily been one of the biggest security incidents that we have seen in recent years. While open-source code is often regarded as more trustworthy than its closed-source counterpart, this attack demonstrates that it comes with its own challenges. Many critical open-source projects are maintained with little funding by overworked volunteers, which might unfortunately make them vulnerable to similar attacks.\\n\\nAnother interesting discovery was related to hyperlinks in Outlook. While Outlook would, under usual circumstances, not follow “file://” protocol links to remote resources, Haifei Li of Check Point Research discovered that just adding an extra exclamation mark (“!”) followed by some arbitrary characters might change this behavior completely. This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2024-21413 and dubbed MonikerLink, as the exclamation mark essentially turns the link into a composite moniker. When a user received an email and clicked on such a link, the remote file would be fetched and possibly parsed in the background.\\n\\nInterestingly, the impact of this is twofold. First, following the link to load a resource from a remote SMB server represents yet another way to force NTLM authentication, allowing the remote server to capture NTLMv2 hashes. Second, an attacker might use this to trigger some vulnerable code, as the fetched resource might be opened in the background, attempting to look up the item moniker (the string appended after the exclamation mark). For instance, the Check Point blog demonstrated this on an RTF file, which would get opened in Microsoft Word outside protected view, representing a very sneaky 1-click vector to deliver an RTF exploit.\\n\\nJan Vojtěšek, Malware Researcher\\n\\nWeb Threats\\n\\nThe significance of web threats can be well seen not only in the numerical statistics but also in the creativity of the scammers themselves. We see scammers trying to take advantage of different trends in different groups. These cybercriminals are using the latest technology in the field of AI, or they are not afraid to invest in their fraudulent practices to improve the sophistication of their scams through other methods.\\n\\nLast quarter, we reported that scams, together with phishing and malvertising, accounted for more than 75% of all threats blocked by Avast throughout the year. This quarter we have blocked over 80% for the same type of threats. This indicates a rather interesting – and very scam-ridden – start to the year.\\n\\nScams Everywhere, Including Video\\n\\nA scam is a type of threat that aims to trick users into giving an attacker their personal information or money. We track diverse types of scams which are listed below.\\n\\nIn our Q4/2023 report, we pointed out that scam activity is increasing significantly. At that time, we saw that one of the main reasons was the high rate of malvertising campaigns. This trend has continued in Q1/2024, with the activity level from the previous peak.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio of scam in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nOur data again shows that sites offer deals and then sending push-notifications are contributing significantly to this trend. With this in mind, we again urge everyone to always consider from which website you want to allow to send you notifications. Also remember that scammers try to disguise these offers of sending notifications as, for example, video players or as adult confirmations.\\n\\nIf you, unfortunately, allow access to malicious notifications, you may encounter the situation shown below.\\n\\nExample of scam push-notifications\\n\\nThe increasing use of malvertising and push-notifications by scammers only confirms our predictions for 2024, when we repeatedly warned that this is a global threat with huge risk potential, especially on mobile phones.\\n\\nIf we look at activity in specific countries, we see that Ukraine exhibited the most significant surge in risk ratio, with a concerning 97% increase (the overall risk ratio for first quarter is set at 16.51%).\\n\\nExample of scam targeting Ukraine users\\n\\nSimilarly, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan displayed significant jumps in their risk ratios, +89% and +56% respectively, marking these countries as emerging hotspots for scam-related threats with overall risk ratios of 14.24% and 12.45%.\\n\\nIf we look further, we see interesting data for India, which also saw an increase in scam threats The current risk ratio for India is 17.26% with a quarter-over-quarter risk ratio increase of +24%.\\n\\nWe identified the highest scam risk ratio Georgia and Serbia in Q1/2024, with more than 30% risk ratio. In the absolute numbers, the majority of scam-targeted users were in France, Brazil, and the US.\\n\\nScam Delivery via Video\\n\\nIn Q1/2024 we continued to witness scam authors heavily using videos as lures in their scams. Whether video made from stock footage or an elaborate deep fake video, scammers are using all video varieties in their threats. One of the most widespread techniques involved exploiting famous individuals and significant media events to attract large audiences. As a result, scammers have devised enticing schemes that capitalize on the familiarity of well-known personalities and important world events.\\n\\nAn increasingly common feature of these campaigns is the use of deep fake videos, created by hijacking official videos from events and using AI to manipulate audio synchronization. These videos seamlessly blend altered audio with existing visuals, making it harder for the untrained eye to tell they’re anything but authentic. Moreover, scammers insert QR codes, leading to well-designed web pages, that promise exclusive opportunities, luring victims into further engagement.\\n\\nDeep fake videos abusing official videos\\n\\nCryptocurrency scams of this type are particularly increasing. Once an individual moves from the video lure to the fraudulent website, they are presented with different scenarios for obtaining “beneficial” cryptocurrencies. Victims are fooled into believing that participating in these schemes will bring considerable profits. The scammers consistently promise victims the same profit margin, and victims receive the impression that – by sending any amount of cryptocurrency to specific wallets – they will receive double the amount in return. The websites even implement fake online wallet monitoring, imitating legitimate transaction activity. Additionally, these deceptive sites typically include images of well-known personalities and logos associated with authentic cryptocurrency-related companies, adding an air of legitimacy.\\n\\nFraudulent websites of the scammer group\\n\\nIn Q1/2024, we observed several other incidents of abuse against famous individuals like Michael J. Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Brad Garlinghouse, and Larry Fink.\\n\\nFake Larry Fink, CEO BlackRock\\n\\nHowever, the most significant cryptocurrency scam incident of the quarter was the misuse of the Starship Integrated Flight Test 3 (IFT-3). The attackers used the official SpaceX All Hands meeting video to deceive viewers and get them to visit the fraudulent websites. Moreover, the attackers have hijacked several YouTube channels, which have tens of millions of subscribers, to increase the probability of displaying a fake video in the list of recommended videos.\\n\\nDeep fake videos abusing SpaceX events\\n\\nThe preliminary analysis indicates that specific attackers’ wallets associated with these scams’ campaigns have cashflows reaching tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\nThe risk ratio of this financial scam was stable in Q1/2024, but we recorded a significant peak on March 14, 2024, related to the IFT-3 event.\\n\\nRisk ratio of the crypt giveaway scam in Q1/2024\\n\\nIn terms of country distribution, the leading countries affected by the scammer group are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\\n\\nCountry distribution of the crypt giveaway scam threat\\n\\nDating Scams Skyrocketing\\n\\nDating scams, also known as romance scams or online dating scams, involve fraudsters deceiving individuals into fake romantic relationships. Scammers adopt fake online identities to gain the victim’s trust, with the ultimate goal of obtaining money or enough personal information to commit identity theft.\\n\\nThe last quarter of last year was very interesting for dating scams, with several large campaigns witnessed through our data. In Q1/2024, we saw a significant increase since the middle of February.\\n\\nWhat is interesting is the high activity especially in Central Europe, with countries like Hungary, Slovakia, Denmark, Austria or the Czech Republic being the most affected.\\n\\nActivity of Dating scam in Q1/2024\\n\\nOnce again, these threats are strongly supported by advertising campaigns. We often see that the sources of these advertising campaigns are sites with adult content. On such pages, the owners often try to get as much commission as possible by trying to fit advertising on their sites with almost every interaction on the page. The user is often overwhelmed with pop-ups or new window redirects, usually to dating scam sites.\\n\\nExample of prevalent dating scam example from Poland\\n\\nAs you can see on the map, Hungary leads with the highest risk ratio rate at 5.06%. Following closely are Slovakia and Luxembourg, with risk ratios of 4.72% and 4.57% respectively.\\n\\nGermany and Austria also show significant exposure to dating scams, with risk ratio rates of 4.27% and 4.10% and lastly, Czechia, with a risk ratio of 3.94%, rounds out the list.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for Dating scam in Q1/2024\\n\\nTech Support Scams (TSS): Steady Increase of Attacks\\n\\nTech support scam threats involve fraudsters posing as legitimate technical support representatives who attempt to gain remote access to victims’ devices or obtain sensitive personal information, such as credit card or banking details. These scams rely on confidence tricks to gain victims’ trust and often involve convincing them to pay for unnecessary services or purchase expensive gift cards. It’s important for internet users to be vigilant and to verify the credentials of anyone claiming to offer technical support services.\\n\\nThroughout 2023, we observed a continual drop in activity related to tech support scams. In the first quarter of this year, we can say that this trend not only ended but quite the contrary – we observed an increase in tech scam activity over the quarter.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio of Technical Support Scam in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nAs seen on the chart above, the activity of this threat has reached the level of the beginning of Q4/2023.\\n\\nLooking at the data of the full quarter, a clear increase trend is visible.\\n\\nDetail of Technical Support Scam risk ratio in Q1/2024\\n\\nSwitzerland experienced the most dramatic surge, with a 177% increase in TSS activity—the highest observed this quarter. Austria also saw a significant rise, with a 101% increase. Germany’s increase, though lower, was still notable at 65%. Additionally, Japan, traditionally a hotspot for TSS, reported a significant increase of 153%.\\n\\nThese escalating figures, especially notable in Europe’s wealthier nations, highlight a growing trend in cybersecurity threats in these regions.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for Technical Support Scam in Q1/2024\\n\\nRefund and Invoice Scams: iCloud Data Deletion Scam\\n\\nInvoice scams involve fraudsters sending false bills or invoices for goods or services that were never ordered or received. Scammers rely on invoices looking legitimate, often using company logos or other branding to trick unsuspecting victims into making payments. These scams can be especially effective when targeted at businesses, as employees may assume that a colleague made the purchase or simply overlook the details of the invoice. It’s important to carefully review all invoices and bills before making any payments and to verify the legitimacy of the sender if there are any suspicions of fraud.\\n\\nOne of the refund and invoice scams that caught our attention in Q1/2024 targeted a top-tier service, serving as a gateway to other less valuable ones, in our assessment. The targeted account was iCloud, accompanied by a TinyURL link to a payment gateway that extracts user information, including sensitive details. iCloud is undoubtedly one of the most vital accounts to protect by enabling multi-factor authentication in order to prevent malicious actors from stealing sensitive information. According to 9to5 Google, enabling multi-factor authentication for Google users led to a 50% decrease in compromised accounts.\\n\\nWe will delve into the campaign itself which begins with a malicious email, which may evoke early 90’s nostalgia because the attackers’ Comic Sans font choice. The aim of the email is to visually intimidate, highlighting the issue at hand: your beloved photos will be deleted unless you proceed to the fake payment gateway. As always, the loading bar creates a sense of urgency, while a missed payment statement compounds the pressure. A big red button labeled “FULL” completes the sense of urgency, signaling that immediate action is required.\\n\\nThe email seemingly contains additional product and technical information to make it look authentic, all of which is fabricated. These include product IDs, expiration dates, and buttons for more storage. The only legitimate piece of the email is the unauthorized use of the actual iCloud logo. The subject of the email is also intriguing: we’re seeing that more cybercriminals aim to catch your attention with email subject lines using emoticons, as you see in the email sample below.\\n\\nExample of iCloud-themed email scam used in Q1/2024\\n\\nIn terms of global prevalence, we can see that the English-speaking world is the most affected, along with the European Union. The countries that experienced the biggest spike in the last quarter are Belgium, up by 29%, the United Kingdom, up by 13%, and Luxembourg, up by 10%. On the other side of the spectrum, we have Australia, which experienced the largest drop, down by 29%, the United States, down by 15%, and Canada, down by 5%.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for Refund and Invoice scam in Q1/2024\\n\\nThe graph showing risk ratio over time exhibits less volatility compared to the previous period. In Q1/2024, the risk did not significantly change over time and rose slightly by the end of the quarter. We can observe that the threat is still widely spread around the globe, and we anticipate seeing even more of these attacks in the future.\\n\\nDaily risk ratio of Refund and Invoice scam in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nPhishing: Reaching New Hights\\n\\nPhishing is a type of online scam where fraudsters attempt to obtain sensitive information including passwords or credit card details by posing as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication, such as an email, text message, or instant message. The fraudulent message usually contains a link to a fake website that looks like the real one, where the victim is asked to enter their sensitive information.\\n\\nAnd now we come to the final, and most classic, category under web threats: Phishing. Like nearly all web threats, this category saw an increase in activity in Q1/2024, continuing the increase trend that we’ve witnessed over the last four quarter.\\n\\nRisk ratio of Phishing during the last 12 months\\n\\nWe’ve also observed that attackers are continuing to make heavy use of file sharing via InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) infrastructure – to spread their phishing content.\\n\\nExample of prevalent phishing hosted on IPFS infrastructure\\n\\nOur statistics show that the most frequently targeted brand on IPFS is Microsoft, which currently accounts for up to 20% of blocked attacks. At the same time, we see that these threats were most visible at the end of Q1/2024.\\n\\nActivity of IPFS based domains for Q1/2024\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for phishing in Q1/2024\\n\\nOne of the most interesting phishing campaigns for this quarter was the wave of Russian-language phishing PDFs targeting bank users.\\n\\nBased on the content of the PDF, this campaign was developed to target the customers of Tinkoff Bank, and from the data we can see that the most hits are registered in Latvia.\\n\\nPhishing email template\\n\\nOne of designs of phishing PDF\\n\\nThis campaign generated hundreds of PDF samples, with different names, while the appearance mostly stayed the same. All extracted URLs pointed to the same domain.\\n\\nExtracted malicious URLs\\n\\nThe main domain to which the URL is redirected is xsph[.]ru. This domain acts as a hub for many other types of malware.\\n\\nCaptcha for verification\\n\\nA command-and-control server, such as one hosted at “the-packaging-experts[.]co.uk” could be accessed by malicious programs by abusing this event. This then redirects to “http://a0942143[.]xsph[.]ru/tin/cabinet/capcha/” and checks CAPTCHA to verify that the user is human, then potentially receives instructions or downloading additional payloads. Threat actors frequently employ this strategy to avoid being discovered by security solutions, using a genuine website as a front for criminal activity.\\n\\nIllustration of the malware relationship linked to xsph[.]ru\\n\\nAlexej Savčin, Malware Analyst\\n\\nMartin Chlumecký, Malware Analyst\\n\\nMatěj Krčma, Malware Analyst\\n\\nPrabhakaran Ravichandhiran, Malware Analyst\\n\\nMobile-Related Threats\\n\\nThe first quarter of 2024 brings with it several interesting developments within the mobile threat landscape. Adware has once again snuck into the PlayStore, this time in the form of a Minecraft clone game app. Meanwhile, MoqHao, a revived strain of banker, obtained the ability to auto-start on victims’ devices once installed, displaying phishing messages on the target device. We also saw GoldPickaxe target both Android and iOS users in Vietnam and Thailand, attempting to steal facial recognition biometrics that are then used in fraudulent payments.\\n\\nState sponsored spyware was also brought back into focus with governments investigating the scope of its use on citizens, while Apple highlighted its threat notifications sent to victims of these sophisticated spywares.\\n\\nFake romance lures were also found, this time by VajraSpy, to entice victims into installing a spyware in India and Pakistan with the intent of extracting data and spying on their devices.\\n\\nFinally, SpyLoans continue to spread on and off the PlayStore, enticing users with promises of quick cash but instead targeting them and their contacts with harassment and blackmail.\\n\\nWeb Threat Data within the Mobile Landscape\\n\\nOver the last few quarters, we’ve started to include web threat data in our mobile threat telemetry. Scams are again at the top of the threat list in the mobile sphere, with a 61% increase in risk ratio compared to last quarter. This is followed by phishing and malvertising, both seeing a 19% increase in risk ratio. The increased prevalence of web threats has significantly reduced the risk ratio of traditional on-device malware such as adware, droppers and others.\\n\\nGraphs showing the most prevalent threats in the mobile sphere in Q1/2024\\n\\nMost blocked attacks on mobile devices in Q1/2024 were web-based, mirroring the previous quarter. Users are much more likely to encounter phishing websites, scams, malvertising and other web threats than ever before. These threats can come in a variety of formats such as private messages, SMS, and emails but also redirects on less reputable sites, unwanted pop ups and through other avenues.\\n\\nIn contrast to these types of mobile scams, traditional on-device malware requires a more complex infection vector where the user must also install the malware. For proper functionality of most mobile malware, permissions need to be granted by the user first, which again lowers the chances of malicious activity being triggered.\\n\\nHence, blocking web-threat based attacks is beneficial for the security of mobile devices, as malware actors often use them as an entry point to get the payload onto the mobile device of their victims.\\n\\nAdware Sneaks into the PlayStore Again\\n\\nAdware threats on mobile phones refer to applications that display intrusive out-of-context adverts to users with the intent of gathering fraudulent advertising revenue. This malicious functionality is often delayed until sometime after installation and coupled with stealthy features such as hiding the adware app icon to prevent removal. Adware mimics popular apps such as games, camera filters, and wallpaper apps, to name a few.\\n\\nAdware stays on top this quarter as the most prevalent on-device malware threat facing mobile users. Continuing to bring in fraudulent advertising revenue at the expense of the user experience of its victims, it again makes its way into the PlayStore to increase its global spread. We also observe third party stores distributing older adware families that are no longer present on the PlayStore.\\n\\nHiddenAds are the most common type of adware this quarter, often hiding their icons once installed on victims’ devices or performing hidden actions in the background with the intent of gathering fraudulent ad views, unbeknownst to the victim. FakeAdBlockers and Mobidash are close behind, often masking as re-packed games that bring with them full screen out of context ads or spam notifications that bother their victims. These continue to spread through third party apps stores and malvertising on less reputable sites that redirect users to download these types of adware.\\n\\nMinecraft clone game apps that display hidden advertisements, raking in fraudulent ad revenue\\n\\nOf note this quarter is the resurgence of a previously discovered adware discussed in the Q2/2023 report, again appearing in the PlayStore with altered versions of the original adware. These Minecraft clone apps draw in millions of downloads due to the popularity of the original game, then proceed to exploit advertising SDKs to display adverts in the background, raking in ad revenue. This fraudulent activity impacts the advertising ecosystem on mobile devices and contributes to data and battery drainage on the victim’s device.\\n\\nWe see a significant decrease in risk ratio this quarter in mobile adware. SocialBar has mostly subsided in comparison to last quarter, accounting for the lower numbers. Alongside this, HiddenAds, FakeAdBlockers, and Mobidash have all experienced a drop in risk ratio this quarter.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio of mobile adware in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nBrazil, India and Argentina have the most protected users this quarter, as was the case last quarter. Egypt, Philippines and Oman have the highest risk ratios, meaning users are most likely to encounter adware in these countries, according to our telemetry.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for mobile adware in Q1/2024\\n\\nNew Auto-Starting Bankers Threaten Mobile Users\\n\\nBankers are a sophisticated type of mobile malware that targets banking details, cryptocurrency wallets, and instant payments with the intent of extracting money. Generally distributed through phishing messages or fake websites, Bankers can take over a victim’s device by abusing the accessibility service. Once installed and enabled, they often monitor 2FA SMS messages and may display fake bank overlays to steal login information.\\n\\nMobile bankers expanded their feature set in Q1/2024 with an unexpected evolution: the ability to auto-start after installation without the need for user input, as exemplified by MoqHao banker. Elsewhere, bankers are digging for gold with the new GoldPickaxe strain that targets both Android and iOS users, attempting to steal facial recognition data for further fraudulent use while emptying bank accounts. Finally, the GreenBean banker was used to redirect crypto payments by changing wallet addresses in victim’s messages. In our telemetry, we see Cerberus/Alien and BankBot with the most protected users, while RewardSteal banker makes a big splash coming in third, mainly targeting India.\\n\\nDisguised as the Chrome browser and using Unicode characters to evade detection, MoqHao requests access to SMS messages\\n\\nWe see another comeback with upgrades, as the MoqHao banker introduces the ability to auto execute after installation through using Android’s inbuilt Contact Provider service. By having this as the first activity in the app manifest with special metadata, it is executed as soon as the app is installed, enabling it to trigger malicious services before it is run for the first time by the user. Once installed and running, MoqHao starts to display phishing messages attempting to trick the user into providing their banking details. It also harvests contact details and SMS messages and sends these away to a C&C server. Interestingly, while the banker has preset country specific phishing messages, it can also dynamically load messages from Pinterest profile descriptions specifically setup for this purpose, a very odd way of delivering tailored messages to its victims. The banker has been distributed through fake phishing SMS messages, often pretending to be a delivery service and mostly targeting users in Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, and India.\\n\\nGoldPickaxe using the guise of Thai Digital Pensions within TestFlight to trick users into installing the banker on iOS\\n\\nGoldPickaxe, a banker targeting both Android and iOS, has emerged and is targeting victims in Thailand and Vietnam. Likely from the same threat actors behind GoldDigger, a previously discussed banker, this new strain focuses on extracting personal information and can even harvest facial recognition data for fraudulent access to victim’s bank accounts. This is likely in response to both the Bank of Thailand and the State Bank of Vietnam issuing statements advising or mandating the use of facial biometric verification for payments in the coming months.\\n\\nOn iOS, the threat actors initially used TestFlight, a beta testing tool within the iOS ecosystem, to distribute the iOS malware. Once Apple took down the offending banker apps, they switched to using Mobile Device Management (MDM) profiles, sending download links to victims. If the victim downloaded and installed the MDM profile, the banker would gain complete control over the device. After the complex infection process is complete, GoldPickaxe can extract photos, SMS messages and even request to capture the victim’s ID card and face. These are then used to initiate fraudulent bank payments, with reports of victims losing significant sums of money after being asked to do facial recognition scans by GoldPickaxe.\\n\\nFake crypto website used to distribute the GreenBean banker malware\\n\\nA new banker called GreenBean has been spotted spreading through a fake cryptocurrency website. Targeting users in China and Vietnam, the banker focuses on cryptocurrency wallets and payment platforms as well as traditional banking platforms. It uses the Accessibility service to gather sensitive information, login details, photos and saved wallet passwords, then sends these away to its C&C. GreenBean is also able to dynamically detect and change crypto wallet addresses it detects within messaging applications such as WeChat, redirecting a payment to its own wallet address, stealing money from victims. Additionally, the banker can stream video from the infected device, keeping an eye on its victims and potentially gaining access to sensitive information.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio of mobile bankers in Q4/2023-Q1/2024\\n\\nBreaking the trend of decline from previous quarters, bankers mostly maintain their prevalence this quarter. It is likely that the introduction of various new strains this quarter has contributed to their steadying numbers. We also observed the return of SMS and messaging applications as infection vectors, used by strains such as FluBot in the past.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for mobile bankers in Q1/2024\\n\\nTurkey has the highest risk ratio for bankers in Q1/2024. We also witnessed a notable rise in risk ratio in India, where the RewardSteal banker is gaining ground. It appears the focus this quarter has shifted towards Asia, with countries such South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam being the targets of several new strains of bankers.\\n\\nState Sponsored Spyware Continues to Be a Sophisticated Threat\\n\\nSpyware is used to spy on unsuspecting victims with the intent of extracting personal information such as messages, photos, location, or login details. It uses fake adverts, phishing messages, and modifications of popular applications to spread and harvest user information. State backed commercial spyware is becoming more prevalent and is used to target individuals with 0-day exploits.\\n\\nMirroring last quarter, Spymax is the most prevalent strain of spyware this quarter, followed by RealRAT, SexInfoSteal, and malicious WAMods. We also saw a few new spyware entries this quarter alongside the return of updated existing strains. Of note are official Apple threat notifications sent to affected users with iOS devices, alerting them when they have been targeted by state sponsored sophisticated spyware attacks. We see VajraSpy spreading in the PlayStore, targeting victims in Pakistan with the ability to steal sensitive data. DogeRAT, a repurposed RainbowRAT clone, makes another entrance on Github with updated and paid features. Finally, SpyLoans continue their blackmailing streak on and off the PlayStore, threatening users worldwide.\\n\\nA sample Threat notification from Apple, alerting the user that they have been targeted by mercenary spyware\\n\\nNews of state sponsored spyware has been doing the rounds for at least a decade now, with examples such as the infamous NSO Group Pegasus dating back to 2016, discussed in the Q3/2021 report. Since 2021, Apple has started issuing threat notifications to potential victims, alerting them if they have been targeted by what Apple believes to be state sponsored or mercenary spyware. These attacks are often highly sophisticated, sometimes using multiple zero-day exploits to break into iOS devices without user interaction, with the intent of spying on their victims and extracting personal information such as SMS messages, contacts and photos. There has been more focus on the use of such spyware by governments, with Poland recently launching a probe into the use of Pegasus by the government, which allegedly targeted close to 600 individuals in Poland. Due to the high cost of such attacks, the attackers are targeting only individuals of interest, NGOs, etc. Users should take extra precautions, such as enabling Lockdown mode on iOS devices and keeping their device up to date with latest security updates.\\n\\nVajraSpy pretending to be a dating app, sent to the victim through a romance lure\\n\\nVajraSpy, an upgraded spyware seen in previous years, has made it onto the PlayStore, targeting users in India and Pakistan. Masquerading as messaging and dating apps, victims were likely approached under the guise of a romantic encounter, where threat actors encouraged victims to download the spyware apps to continue their interaction. It appears there were three distinct versions of the malware, two of which were messaging applications with the ability to extract SMS messages, WhatsApp conversations and photos, the more advanced version even able to record audio and video, log keystrokes, and listen in on phone calls. The third version disguised itself as a news app and didn’t request any dangerous permissions. Despite this, it was able to steal contacts and various documents and files from external storage.\\n\\nDogeRAT’s list of paid features on Github with ambitious promises such as “undetectable by antivirus”\\n\\nGithub is again being used for distribution of potential malware in this case DogeRAT. This update appears to be a repurposed version of RainbowRAT, and even features a paid version that promises to be undetectable by antivirus in addition to having the ability to extract all photos on a device, screenshot the victim’s screen and provide a keylogger to track inputs. While dangerous, open repositories such as this one offer an interesting insight into the operation of various threat actors. Normally, threat groups try to hide their activity to evade detection and remain under the radar for as long as possible to avoid takedowns and antivirus detection.\\n\\nReview of a SpyLoan application on the PlayStore, citing the abusive use of contacts and data theft which is used to coerce victims\\n\\nSpyLoans continue to reign on the PlayStore, targeting victims in need of quick cash with promises of easy payments, low interest rates and hassle-free setup. Numerous apps have been taken down from the PlayStore, as discussed in previous quarters, but new ones keep popping up. The actors behind these apps have also taken to using third party app stores or even direct messaging to entice victims into downloading their malware. Once installed, the SpyLoans generally harvest contacts, photos and SMS messages under the guise of a credit check. This data is then used to harass and blackmail victims, in some cases even threating violence. Users are advised to stick to official banks when in need of a loan, to avoid SpyLoan apps.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio of mobile spyware in Q4/2023 and Q1/2024\\n\\nThe risk ratio for mobile spyware has remained steady compared to Q4/2023, with a very slight decrease in prevalence of spyware in our telemetry. The continued spread of SpyLoans may have contributed to this.\\n\\nGlobal risk ratio for mobile spyware in Q1/2024\\n\\nYemen has the highest risk ratio this quarter, followed by Turkey, Egypt and Pakistan. We saw VajraSpy mainly focus on Pakistan this quarter, where we do see an increase in risk ratio. Brazil and the US have the highest number of protected users.\\n\\nJakub Vávra, Malware Analyst'),\n",

On 2023-07-31, eScan confirmed that the issue was fixed and successfully resolved\\n\\nThe campaign was orchestrated by a threat actor with possible ties to Kimsuky\\n\\nTwo different types of backdoors have been discovered, targeting large corporate networks\\n\\nThe final payload distributed by GuptiMiner was also XMRig\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nWe’ve been tracking a curious one here. Firstly, GuptiMiner is a highly sophisticated threat that uses an interesting infection chain along with a couple of techniques that include performing DNS requests to the attacker’s DNS servers, performing sideloading, extracting payloads from innocent-looking images, signing its payloads with a custom trusted root anchor certification authority, among others.\\n\\nThe main objective of GuptiMiner is to distribute backdoors within big corporate networks. We’ve encountered two different variants of these backdoors: The first is an enhanced build of PuTTY Link, providing SMB scanning of the local network and enabling lateral movement over the network to potentially vulnerable Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 systems on the network. The second backdoor is multi-modular, accepting commands from the attacker to install more modules as well as focusing on scanning for stored private keys and cryptowallets on the local system.\\n\\nInterestingly, GuptiMiner also distributes XMRig on the infected devices, which is a bit unexpected for such a thought-through operation.\\n\\nThe actors behind GuptiMiner have been capitalizing on an insecurity within an update mechanism of Indian antivirus vendor eScan to distribute the malware by performing a man-in-the-middle attack. We disclosed this security vulnerability to both eScan and the India CERT and received confirmation on 2023-07-31 from eScan that the issue was fixed and successfully resolved.\\n\\nGuptiMiner is a long-standing malware, with traces of it dating back to 2018 though it is likely that it is even older. We have also found that GuptiMiner has possible ties to Kimsuky, a notorious North Korean APT group, by observing similarities between Kimsuky keylogger and parts of the GuptiMiner operation.\\n\\nIn this analysis, we will cover the GuptiMiner’s features and its evolution over time. We will also denote in which samples the particular features are contained or introduced to support the overall comprehension in the vast range of IoCs.\\n\\nIt is also important to note that since the users rarely install more than one AV on their machine, we may have limited visibility into GuptiMiner’s activity and its overall scope. Because of this, we might be looking only at the tip of the iceberg and the true scope of the entire operation may still be subject to discovery.\\n\\nInfection Chain\\n\\nTo illustrate the complexity of the whole infection, we’ve provided a flow chart containing all parts of the chain. Note that some of the used filenames and/or workflows can slightly vary depending on the specific version of GuptiMiner, but the flowchart below illustrates the overall process.\\n\\nThe whole process starts with eScan requesting an update from the update server where an unknown MitM intercepts the download and swaps the update package with a malicious one. Then, eScan unpacks and loads the package and a DLL is sideloaded by eScan clean binaries. This DLL enables the rest of the chain, following with multiple shellcodes and intermediary PE loaders.\\n\\nResulted GuptiMiner consists of using XMRig on the infected machine as well as introducing backdoors which are activated when deployed in large corporate networks.\\n\\nGuptiMiner’s infection chain\\n\\nEvolution and Timelines\\n\\nGuptiMiner has been active since at least 2018. Over the years, the developers behind it have improved the malware significantly, bringing new features to the table. We will describe the specific features in detail in respective subsections.\\n\\nWith that said, we also wanted to illustrate the significant IoCs in a timeline representation, how they changed over time – focusing on mutexes, PDBs, and used domains. These timelines were created based on scanning for the IoCs over a large sample dataset, taking the first and last compilation timestamps of the samples, then forming the intervals. Note that the scanned dataset is larger than listed IoCs in the IoC section. For more detailed list of IoCs, please visit our GitHub.\\n\\nDomains in Time\\n\\nIn general, GuptiMiner uses the following types of domains during its operations:\\n\\nMalicious DNS – GuptiMiner hosts their own DNS servers for serving true destination domain addresses of C&C servers via DNS TXT responses\\n\\n– GuptiMiner hosts their own DNS servers for serving true destination domain addresses of C&C servers via DNS TXT responses Requested domains – Domains for which the malware queries the DNS servers for\\n\\n– Domains for which the malware queries the DNS servers for PNG download – Servers for downloading payloads in the form of PNG files. These PNG files are valid images (a logo of T-Mobile) that contain appended shellcodes at their end\\n\\n– Servers for downloading payloads in the form of PNG files. These PNG files are valid images (a logo of T-Mobile) that contain appended shellcodes at their end Config mining pool – GuptiMiner contains two different configurations of mining pools. One is hardcoded directly in the XMRig config which is denoted in this group\\n\\n– GuptiMiner contains two different configurations of mining pools. One is hardcoded directly in the XMRig config which is denoted in this group Modified mining pool – GuptiMiner has the ability to modify the pre-defined mining pools which is denoted in this group\\n\\n– GuptiMiner has the ability to modify the pre-defined mining pools which is denoted in this group Final C&C – Domains that are used in the last backdoor stage of GuptiMiner, providing additional malware capabilities in the backdoored systems\\n\\n– Domains that are used in the last backdoor stage of GuptiMiner, providing additional malware capabilities in the backdoored systems Other – Domains serving different purposes, e.g., used in scripts\\n\\nNote that as the malware connects to the malicious DNS servers directly, the DNS protocol is completely separated from the DNS network. Thus, no legitimate DNS server will ever see the traffic from this malware. The DNS protocol is used here as a functional equivalent of telnet. Because of this, this technique is not a DNS spoofing since spoofing traditionally happens on the DNS network.\\n\\nFurthermore, the fact that the servers for which GuptiMiner asks for in the Requested domain category actually exist is purely a coincidence, or rather a network obfuscation to confuse network monitoring tools and analysts.\\n\\nTimeline illustrating GuptiMiner’s usage of domains in time\\n\\nFrom this timeline, it is apparent that authors behind GuptiMiner realize the correct setup of their DNS servers is crucial for the whole chain to work properly. Because of this, we can observe the biggest rotation and shorter timeframes are present in the Malicious DNS group.\\n\\nFurthermore, since domains in the Requested domain group are irrelevant (at least from the technical viewpoint), we can notice that the authors are reusing the same domain names for longer periods of time.\\n\\nMutexes in Time\\n\\nMutexes help ensure correct execution flow of a software and malware authors often use these named objects for the same purpose. Since 2018, GuptiMiner has changed its mutexes multiple times. Most significantly, we can notice a change since 2021 where the authors changed the mutexes to reflect the compilation/distribution dates of their new versions.\\n\\nTimeline illustrating GuptiMiner’s usage of mutexes in time\\n\\nAn attentive reader can likely observe two takeaways: The first is the apparent outliers in usage of MIVOD_6 , SLDV15 , SLDV13 , and Global\\\\Wed Jun 2 09:43:03 2021 . According to our data, these mutexes were truly reused multiple times in different builds, creating larger timeframes than expected.\\n\\nAnother point is the re-introduction of PROCESS_ mutex near the end of last year. At this time, the authors reintroduced the mutex with the string in UTF-16 encoding, which we noted separately.\\n\\nPDBs in Time\\n\\nWith regard to debugging symbols, the authors of GuptiMiner left multiple PDB paths in their binaries. Most of the time, they contain strings like MainWork , Projects , etc.\\n\\nTimeline illustrating PDBs contained in GuptiMiner in time\\n\\nStage 0 – Installation Process\\n\\nIntercepting the Updates\\n\\nEveryone should update their software, right? Usually, the individual either downloads the new version manually from the official vendor’s site, or – preferably – the software itself performs the update automatically without much thought or action from the user. But what happens when someone is able to hijack this automatic process?\\n\\nOur investigation started as we began to observe some of our users were receiving unusual responses from otherwise legitimate requests, for example on:\\n\\nhttp://update3[.]mwti[.]net/pub/update/updll3.dlz\\n\\nThis is truly a legitimate URL to download the updll3.dlz file which is, under normal circumstances, a legitimate archive containing the update of the eScan antivirus. However, we started seeing suspicious behavior on some of our clients, originating exactly from URLs like this.\\n\\nWhat we uncovered was that the actors behind GuptiMiner were performing man-in-the-middle (MitM) to download an infected installer on the victim’s PC, instead of the update. Unfortunately, we currently don’t have information on how the MitM was performed. We assume that some kind of pre-infection had to be present on the victim’s device or their network, causing the MitM.\\n\\nUpdate Package\\n\\nc3122448ae3b21ac2431d8fd523451ff25de7f6e399ff013d6fa6953a7998fa3\\n\\n(version.dll, 2018-04-19 09:47:41 UTC)\\n\\nThroughout the analysis, we will try to describe not just the flow of the infection chain, malware techniques, and functionalities of the stages, but we will also focus on different versions, describing how the malware authors developed and changed GuptiMiner over time.\\n\\nThe first GuptiMiner sample that we were able to find was compiled on Tuesday, 2018-04-19 09:47:41 and it was uploaded to VirusTotal the day after from India, followed by an upload from Germany:\\n\\nc3122448ae3b21ac2431d8fd523451ff25de7f6e399ff013d6fa6953a7998fa3\\n\\nThis file was named C:\\\\Program Files\\\\eScan\\\\VERSION.DLL which points out the target audience is truly eScan users and it comes from an update package downloaded by the AV.\\n\\nEven though this version lacked several features present in the newer samples, the installation process is still the same, as follows:\\n\\nThe eScan updater triggers the update The downloaded package file is replaced with a malicious one on the wire because of a missing HTTPS encryption (MitM is performed) A malicious package updll62.dlz is downloaded and unpacked by eScan updater The contents of the package contain a malicious DLL (usually called version.dll ) that is sideloaded by eScan. Because of the sideloading, the DLL runs with the same privileges as the source process – eScan – and it is loaded next time eScan runs, usually after a system restart If a mutex is not present in the system (depends on the version, e.g. Mutex_ONLY_ME_V1 ), the malware searches for services.exe process and injects its next stage into the first one it can find Cleanup is performed, removing the update package\\n\\nThe malicious DLL contains additional functions which are not present in the clean one. Thankfully the names are very verbose, so no analysis was required for most of them. The list of the functions can be seen below.\\n\\nAdditional exported functions\\n\\nSome functions, however, are unique. For example, the function X64Call provides Heaven’s gate, i.e., it is a helper function for running x64 code inside a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system. The malware needs this to be able to run the injected shellcode depending on the OS version and thus the bitness of the services.exe process.\\n\\nHeaven’s gate to run the shellcode in x64 environment when required\\n\\nTo keep the original eScan functionality intact, the malicious version.dll also needs to handle the original legacy version.dll functionality. This is done by forwarding all the exported functions from the original DLL. When a call of the legacy DLL function is identified, GuptiMiner resolves the original function and calls it afterwards.\\n\\nResolving function that ensures all the original version.dll exports are available\\n\\nInjected Shellcode in services.exe\\n\\nAfter the shellcode is injected into services.exe , it serves as a loader of the next stage. This is done by reading an embedded PE file in a plaintext form.\\n\\nEmbedded PE file loaded by the shellcode\\n\\nThis PE file is loaded by standard means, but additionally, the shellcode also destroys the PE’s DOS header and runs it by calling its entry point, as well as it removes the embedded PE from the original location memory altogether.\\n\\nCommand Line Manipulation\\n\\nAcross the entire GuptiMiner infection chain, every shellcode which is loading and injecting PE files also manipulates the command line of the current process. This is done by manipulating the result of GetCommandLineA/W which changes the resulted command line displayed for example in Task Manager.\\n\\nCommand line manipulation function\\n\\nAfter inspecting this functionality, we believe it either doesn’t work as the authors intended or we don’t understand its usage. Long story short, the command line is changed in such a way that everything before the first --parameter is skipped, and this parameter is then appended to the process name.\\n\\nTo illustrate this, we could take a command:\\n\\nnotepad.exe param1 --XX param2\\n\\nwhich will be transformed into:\\n\\nnotepad.exeXX param2\\n\\nHowever, we have not seen a usage like power --shell.exe param1 param2 that would result into:\\n\\npowershell.exe param1 param2\\n\\nnor have we seen any concealment of parameters (like usernames and passwords for XMRig), a type of behavior we would anticipate when encountering something like this. In either case, this functionality is obfuscating the command line appearance, which is worth mentioning. An interested reader can play around with the functionality at the awesome godbolt.org here.\\n\\nCode Virtualization\\n\\n7a1554fe1c504786402d97edecc10c3aa12bd6b7b7b101cfc7a009ae88dd99c6\\n\\n(version.dll, 2018-06-12 03:30:01)\\n\\nAnother version with a mutex ONLY_ME_V3 introduced a code virtualization. This can be observed by an additional section in the PE file called .v_lizer . This section was also renamed a few times in later builds.\\n\\nA new section with the virtualized code is called .v_lizer\\n\\nThankfully the obfuscation is rather weak, provided the shellcode as well as the embedded PE file are still in the plaintext form.\\n\\nFurthermore, the authors started to distinguish between the version.dll stage and the PE file loaded by the shellcode by additional mutex. Previously, both stages used the shared mutex ONLY_ME_Vx , now the sideloading uses MTX_V101 as a mutex.\\n\\nStage 0.9 – Installation Improvements\\n\\n3515113e7127dc41fb34c447f35c143f1b33fd70913034742e44ee7a9dc5cc4c\\n\\n(2021-03-28 14:41:07 UTC)\\n\\nThe installation process has undergone multiple improvements over time, and, since it is rather different compared to older variants, we decided to describe it separately as an intermediary Stage 0.9. With these improvements, the authors introduced a usage of scheduled tasks, WMI events, two differently loaded next stages (Stage 1 – PNG loader), turning off Windows Defender, and installing crafted certificates to Windows.\\n\\nThere are also multiple files dropped at this stage, enabling further sideloading by the malware. These files are clean and serve exclusively for sideloading purposes. The malicious DLLs that are being sideloaded, are two PNG loaders (Stage 1):\\n\\nde48abe380bd84b5dc940743ad6727d0372f602a8871a4a0ae2a53b15e1b1739 *atiadlxx.dll\\n\\ne0dd8af1b70f47374b0714e3b368e20dbcfa45c6fe8f4a2e72314f4cd3ef16ee *BrLogAPI.dll\\n\\nWMI Events\\n\\nde48abe380bd84b5dc940743ad6727d0372f602a8871a4a0ae2a53b15e1b1739\\n\\n(atiadlxx.dll, 2021-03-28 14:30:11 UTC)\\n\\nAt this stage, WMI events are used for loading the first of the PNG loaders. This loader is extracted to a path:\\n\\nC:\\\\PROGRAMDATA\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\atiadlxx.dll\\n\\nAlong with it, additional clean files are dropped, and they are used for sideloading, in either of these locations (can be both):\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\slsnotif.exe\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\msvcr120.dll\\n\\nor\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\CCCSlim\\\\slsnotify.exe\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\CCCSlim\\\\msvcr120.dll\\n\\nThe clean file slsnotify.exe is then registered via WMI event in such a way that it is executed when these conditions are met:\\n\\nWMI conditions to trigger sideloading\\n\\nIn other words, the sideloading is performed on a workday in either January, July, or November. The numbers represented by %d are randomly selected values. The two possibilities for the hour are exactly two hours apart and fall within the range of 11–16 or 13–18 (inclusive). This conditioning further underlines the longevity of GuptiMiner operations.\\n\\nScheduled Tasks\\n\\ne0dd8af1b70f47374b0714e3b368e20dbcfa45c6fe8f4a2e72314f4cd3ef16ee\\n\\n(BrLogAPI.dll, 2021-03-28 14:10:27 UTC)\\n\\nSimilarly to the WMI events, GuptiMiner also drops a clean binary for sideloading at this location:\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\\\BrRemPnP.exe\\n\\nThe malicious PNG loader is then placed in one (or both) of these locations:\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\\\BrLogAPI.dll\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\\\BrLogAPI.dll\\n\\nThe scheduled task is created by invoking a Task Scheduler. The scheduled task has these characteristics:\\n\\nIt is created and named as C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\n\\nExecutes: C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\\\BrRemPnP.exe\\n\\nThe execution is done under a folder containing the to-be-sideloaded DLL, e.g.: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Brother\\\\Brmfl14c\\\\\\n\\nThe execution is performed with every boot ( TASK_TRIGGER_BOOT ) with SYSTEM privileges\\n\\nDeploy During Shutdown\\n\\n3515113e7127dc41fb34c447f35c143f1b33fd70913034742e44ee7a9dc5cc4c\\n\\n(2021-03-28 14:41:07 UTC)\\n\\nLet’s now look at how all these files, clean and malicious, are being deployed. One of GuptiMiner’s tricks is that it drops the final payload, containing PNG loader stage, only during the system shutdown process. Thus, this happens at the time other applications are shutting down and potentially not protecting the user anymore.\\n\\nThe main flow of the Stage 0.9 variant – drops final payload during system shutdown\\n\\nFrom the code above, we can observe that only when the SM_SHUTTINGDOWN metric is non-zero, meaning the current session is shutting down, as well as all the supporting clean files were dropped successfully, the final payload DLL is dropped as well.\\n\\nAn engaged reader could also notice in the code above that the first function that is being called disables Windows Defender. This is done by standard means of modifying registry keys. Only if the Defender is disabled can the malware proceed with the malicious actions.\\n\\nAdding Certificates to Windows\\n\\nMost of the time, GuptiMiner uses self-signed binaries for their malicious activities. However, this time around, the attackers went a step further. In this case, both of the dropped PNG loader DLLs are signed with a custom trusted root anchor certification authority. This means that the signature is inherently untrusted since the attackers’ certification authority cannot be trusted by common verification processes in Windows.\\n\\nHowever, during the malware installation, GuptiMiner also adds a root certificate to Windows’ certificate store making this certification authority trusted. Thus, when such a signed file is executed, it is understood as correctly signed. This is done by using CertCreateCertificateContext , CertOpenStore , and CertAddCertificateContextToStore API functions.\\n\\nFunction which adds GuptiMiner’s root certificate to Windows\\n\\nThe certificate is present in a plaintext form directly in the GuptiMiner binary file.\\n\\nA certificate in the plaintext form which is added as root to Windows by the malware\\n\\nDuring our research, we found three different certificate issuers used during the GuptiMiner operations:\\n\\nGTE Class 3 Certificate Authority\\n\\nVeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2010\\n\\nDigiCert Assured ID Code Signing CA\\n\\nNote that these names are artificial and any resemblance to legitimate certification authorities shall be considered coincidental.\\n\\nStoring Payloads in Registry\\n\\n8e96d15864ec0cc6d3976d87e9e76e6eeccc23c551b22dcfacb60232773ec049\\n\\n(upgradeshow.dll, 2023-11-23 16:41:34 UTC)\\n\\nAt later development stages, authors behind GuptiMiner started to integrate even better persistence of their payloads by storing the payloads in registry keys. Furthermore, the payloads were also encrypted by XOR using a fixed key. This ensures that the payloads look meaningless to the naked eye.\\n\\nWe’ve discovered these registry key locations to be utilized for storing the payloads so far:\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Nls\\\\Sorting\\\\Ids\\\\en-US\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\PnP\\\\Pci\\\\CardList\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Wdf\\\\DMCF\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\StorVSP\\\\Parsers\\n\\nStage 1 – PNG Loader\\n\\nff884d4c01fccf08a916f1e7168080a2d740a62a774f18e64f377d23923b0297\\n\\n(2018-04-19 09:45:25 UTC)\\n\\nWhen the entry point of the PE file is executed by the shellcode from Stage 0, the malware first creates a scheduled task to attempt to perform cleanup of the initial infection by removing updll62.dlz archive and version.dll library from the system.\\n\\nFurthermore, the PE serves as a dropper for additional stages by contacting an attacker’s malicious DNS server. This is done by sending a DNS request to the attacker’s DNS server, obtaining the TXT record with the response. The TXT response holds an encrypted URL domain of a real C&C server that should be requested for an additional payload. This payload is a valid PNG image file (a T-Mobile logo) which also holds a shellcode appended to its end. The shellcode is afterwards executed by the malware in a separate thread, providing further malware functionality as a next stage.\\n\\nNote that since the DNS server itself is malicious, the requested domain name doesn’t really matter – or, in a more abstract way of thinking about this functionality, it can be rather viewed as a “password” which is passed to the server, deciding whether the DNS server should or shouldn’t provide the desired TXT answer carrying the instructions.\\n\\nAs we already mentioned in the Domains timeline section, there are multiple of such “Requested domains” used. In the version referenced here, we can see these two being used:\\n\\next.peepzo[.]com\\n\\ncrl.peepzo[.]com\\n\\nand the malicious DNS server address is in this case:\\n\\nns1.peepzo[.]com\\n\\nHere we can see a captured DNS TXT response using Wireshark. Note that Transaction ID = 0x034b was left unchanged during all the years of GuptiMiner operations. We find this interesting because we would expect this could get easily flagged by firewalls or EDRs in the affected network.\\n\\nDNS TXT response captured by Wireshark\\n\\nThe requests when the malware is performing the queries is done in random intervals. The initial request for the DNS TXT record is performed in the first 20 minutes after the PNG loader is executed. The consecutive requests, which are done for the malware’s update routine, wait up to 69 hours between attempts.\\n\\nThis update mechanism is reflected by creating separate mutexes with the shellcode version number which is denoted by the first two bytes of the decrypted DNS TXT response (see below for the decryption process). This ensures that no shellcode with the same version is run twice on the system.\\n\\nMutex is numbered by the shellcode’s version information\\n\\nDNS TXT Record Decryption\\n\\nAfter the DNS TXT record is received, GuptiMiner decodes the content using base64 and decrypts it with a combination of MD5 used as a key derivation function and the RC2 cipher for the decryption. Note that in the later versions of this malware, the authors improved the decryption process by also using checksums and additional decryption keys.\\n\\nFor the key derivation function and the decryption process, the authors decided to use standard Windows CryptoAPI functions.\\n\\nTypical use of standard Windows CryptoAPI functions\\n\\nInterestingly, a keen eye can observe an oversight in this initialization process shown above, particularly in the CryptHashData function. The prototype of the CryptHashData API function is:\\n\\nBOOL CryptHashData(\\n\\n[in] HCRYPTHASH hHash,\\n\\n[in] const BYTE *pbData,\\n\\n[in] DWORD dwDataLen,\\n\\n[in] DWORD dwFlags\\n\\n);\\n\\nThe second argument of this function is a pointer to an array of bytes of a length of dwDataLen . However, this malware provides the string L\"POVO@1\" in a Unicode (UTF-16) format, represented by the array of bytes *pbData .\\n\\nThus, the first six bytes from this array are only db \\'P\\', 0, \\'O\\', 0, \\'V\\', 0 which effectively cuts the key in half and padding it with zeroes. Even though the malware authors changed the decryption key throughout the years, they never fixed this oversight, and it is still present in the latest version of GuptiMiner.\\n\\nDNS TXT Record Parsing\\n\\nAt this point, we would like to demonstrate the decrypted TXT record and how to parse it. In this example, while accessing the attacker’s malicious DNS server ns.srnmicro[.]net and the requested domain spf.microsoft[.]com , the server returned this DNS TXT response:\\n\\nVUBw2mOgagCILdD3qWwVMQFPUd0dPHO3MS/CwpL2bVESh9OnF/Pgs6mHPLktvph2\\n\\nAfter fully decoding and decrypting this string, we get:\\n\\nThis result contains multiple fields and can be interpreted as:\\n\\nName Value Version 1 1 Version 2 5 Key size \\\\r (= 0xD ) Key Microsoft.com C&C URL http://www.deanmiller[.]net/m/ Checksum \\\\xde\\n\\nThe first two bytes, Version 1 and Version 2, form the PNG shellcode version. It is not clear why there are two such versions since Version 2 is actually never used in the program. Only Version 1 is considered whether to perform the update – i.e., whether to download and load the PNG shellcode or not. In either case, we could look at these numbers as a major version and a minor version, and only the major releases serve as a trigger for the update process.\\n\\nThe third byte is a key size that denotes how many bytes should be read afterwards, forming the key. Furthermore, no additional delimiter is needed between the key and the URL since the key size is known and the URL follows. Finally, the two-byte checksum can be verified by calculating a sum of all the bytes (modulo 0xFF ).\\n\\nAfter the DNS TXT record is decoded and decrypted, the malware downloads the next stage, from the provided URL, in the form of a PNG file. This is done by using standard WinINet Windows API, where the User-Agent is set to contain the bitness of the currently running process.\\n\\nThe malware communicates the bitness of the running process to the C&C\\n\\nThe C&C server uses the User-Agent information for two things:\\n\\nProvides the next stage (a shellcode) in the correct bitness\\n\\nFilters any HTTP request that doesn’t contain this information as a protection mechanism\\n\\nParsing the PNG File\\n\\nAfter the downloaded file is a valid PNG file which also contains a shellcode appended at the end. The image is a T-Mobile logo and has exactly 805 bytes. These bytes are skipped by the malware and the rest of the file, starting at an offset 0x325 , is decrypted by RC2 using the key provided in the TXT response (derived using MD5). The reason of using an image as this “prefix” is to further obfuscate the network communication where the payload looks like a legitimate image, likely overlooking the appended malware code.\\n\\nPNG file containing the shellcode starting at 0x325\\n\\nAfter the shellcode is loaded from the position 0x325 , it proceeds with loading additional PE loader from memory to unpack next stages using Gzip.\\n\\nIP Address Masking\\n\\n294b73d38b89ce66cfdefa04b1678edf1b74a9b7f50343d9036a5d549ade509a\\n\\n(2023-11-09 14:19:45 UTC)\\n\\nIn late 2023, the authors decided to ditch the years-long approach of using DNS TXT records for distributing payloads and they switched to IP address masking instead.\\n\\nThis new approach consists of a few steps:\\n\\nObtain an IP address of a hardcoded server name registered to the attacker by standard means of using gethostbyname API function For that server, two IP addresses are returned – the first is an IP address which is a masked address, and the second one denotes an available payload version and starts with 23.195. as the first two octets If the version is newer than the current one, the masked IP address is de-masked and results in a real C&C IP address The real C&C IP address is used along with a hardcoded constant string (used in a URL path) to download the PNG file containing the shellcode\\n\\nThe de-masking process is done by XORing each octet of the IP address by 0xA , 0xB , 0xC , 0xD , respectively. The result is then taken, and a hardcoded constant string is added to the URL path.\\n\\nAs an example, one such server we observed was www.elimpacific[.]net . It was, at the time, returning:\\n\\nThe address 23.195.101[.]1 denotes a version and if it is greater than the current version, it performs the update by downloading the PNG file with the shellcode. This update is downloaded by requesting a PNG file from the real C&C server whose address is calculated by de-masking the 179.38.204[.]38 address:\\n\\nThe request is then made, along with the calculated IP address 185.45.192[.]43 and a hardcoded constant elimp . Using a constant like this serves as an additional password, in a sense:\\n\\n185.45.192[.]43/elimp/\\n\\nGuptiMiner is requesting the payload from a real IP address\\n\\nWhen the PNG file is downloaded, the rest of the process is the same as usual.\\n\\nWe’ve discovered two servers for this functionality so far:\\n\\nQueried server URL path constant www.elimpacific[.]net elimp www.espcomp[.]net OpenSans\\n\\nAnti-VM and Anti-debug Tricks\\n\\n294b73d38b89ce66cfdefa04b1678edf1b74a9b7f50343d9036a5d549ade509a\\n\\n(2023-11-09 14:19:45 UTC)\\n\\nAlong with other updates described above, we also observed an evolution in using anti-VM and anti-debugging tricks. These are done by checking well known disk drivers, registry keys, and running processes.\\n\\nGuptiMiner checks for these disk drivers by enumerating\\n\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\services\\\\Disk\\\\Enum :\\n\\nvmware\\n\\nqemu\\n\\nvbox\\n\\nvirtualhd\\n\\nSpecifically, the malware also checks the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Cylance for the presence of Cylance AV.\\n\\nAs other anti-VM measures, the malware also checks whether the system has more than 4GB available RAM and at least 4 CPU cores.\\n\\nLast but not least, the malware also checks the presence of these processes by their prefixes:\\n\\nProcess name prefix Tool name wireshar Wireshark windbg.

Contrary to storing the payloads, the images are not additionally XORed since the shellcodes in them are already encrypted using RC2 (see DNS TXT Record Decryption section for details).\\n\\nWe’ve discovered these registry key locations to be utilized for storing the encrypted images containing the shellcodes so far:\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Arbiters\\\\Class\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\Class\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\CORE\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\DEF\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\Els\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\ASN\\n\\nSYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\MSDTC\\\\BSR\\n\\nStage 2 – Gzip Loader\\n\\n357009a70daacfc3379560286a134b89e1874ab930d84edb2d3ba418f7ad6a0b\\n\\n(2019-04-02 07:30:21 UTC)\\n\\nThis stage is the shortest, the Gzip loader, which is extracted and executed by the shellcode from the PNG file, is a simple PE that decompresses another shellcode using Gzip and executes it in a separate thread.\\n\\nThis thread additionally loads Stage 3, which we call Puppeteer, that orchestrates the core functionality of the malware – the cryptocurrency mining as well as, when applicable, deploying backdoors on the infected systems.\\n\\nThroughout the GuptiMiner operations, Gzip loader has not been changed with later versions.\\n\\nStage 3 – Puppeteer\\n\\n364984e8d62eb42fd880755a296bd4a93cc071b9705c1f1b43e4c19dd84adc65\\n\\n(2019-03-15 10:07:36 UTC)\\n\\nLet’s now look at the biggest Stage 3, the Puppeteer. It pulls its strings everywhere across the infected system, manipulating the GuptiMiner components to do its bidding, hence the name we’ve chosen. It orchestrates further actions and deploys two core components of the malware – an XMRig coinminer and two types of backdoors that target devices present in large corporate networks. Of course, Puppeteer also introduces additional tricks to the arsenal of the whole GuptiMiner operation.\\n\\nThis stage also uses one of the many Global\\\\SLDV mutexes which we described in the Mutex timeline. For example, this particular sample uses SLDV01 as its mutex.\\n\\nPuppeteer Setup\\n\\nPuppeteer performs several steps for a proper setup. Firstly, it adds a new power scheme in Windows so the PC does not go to sleep. If the CPU has only one core (anti-VM) or the mutex already exists, the malware ceases to function by going to infinite sleep.\\n\\nIn the next phase, the malware kills all the processes with a name msiexec.exe , cmstp.exe , or credwiz.exe . After that, it creates a separate thread that injects XMRig into a credwiz.exe process freshly created by the malware. The malware also disables Windows Defender by setting its service start status to disabled.\\n\\nFor the persistence, Puppeteer chose an interesting approach. Firstly, it creates a scheduled task with the following configuration:\\n\\nA legitimate rundll32.exe file is copied and renamed into C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Crypto\\\\Escan\\\\dss.exe and this file is executed from the scheduled task\\n\\nfile is copied and renamed into and this file is executed from the scheduled task The malicious DLL is placed to C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Crypto\\\\Escan\\\\updll3.dll3 and this file is loaded by dss.exe (exported function ValidateFile )\\n\\nand this file is loaded by (exported function ) The task is executed with every boot ( TASK_TRIGGER_BOOT ) and TASK_RUNLEVEL_HIGHEST priority\\n\\n) and priority The task is named and located at C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\tasks\\\\Microsoft\\\\windows\\\\autochk\\\\ESUpgrade\\n\\nWith that, the malware copies the content of updll3.dll3 into memory and deletes the original file from disk. Puppeteer then waits for a system shutdown (similarly to Stage 0.9) by waiting for SM_SHUTTINGDOWN metric to be set to non-zero value, indicating the shutdown. This is checked every 100 milliseconds. Only when the shutdown of the system is initiated, the malware reintroduces the updll3.dll3 file back onto disk.\\n\\nPutting the malicious DLL back just before the system restart is really sneaky but also has potentially negative consequences. If the victim’s device encounters a crash, power outage, or any other kind of unexpected shutdown, the file won’t be restored from memory and Puppeteer will stop working from this point. Perhaps this is the reason why authors actually removed this trick in later versions, trading the sophistication for malware’s stability.\\n\\nA code ensuring the correct after-reboot execution\\n\\nThe repetitive loading of updll3.dll3 , as seen in the code above, is in fact Puppeteer’s update process. The DLL will ultimately perform steps of requesting a new PNG shellcode from the C&C servers and if it is a new version, the chain will be updated.\\n\\nXMRig Deployment\\n\\nDuring the setup, Puppeteer created a separate thread for injecting an XMRig coinminer into credwiz.exe process. Before the injection takes place, however, a few preparation steps are performed.\\n\\nThe XMRig configuration is present directly in the XMRig binary (standard JSON config) stored in the Puppeteer binary. This configuration can be, however, modified to different values on the fly. In the example below, we can see a dynamic allocation of mining threads depending on the robustness of the infected system’s hardware.\\n\\nPatching the XMRig configuration on the fly, dynamically assigning mining threads\\n\\nThe injection is standard: the malware creates a new suspended process of credwiz.exe and, if successful, the coinmining is injected and executed by WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread combo.\\n\\nPuppeteer continuously monitors the system for running process, by default every 5 seconds. If it encounters any of the monitoring tools below, the malware kills any existing mining by taking down the whole credwiz.exe process as well as it applies a progressive sleep, postponing another re-injection attempt by additional 5 hours.\\n\\ntaskmgr.exe\\n\\nautoruns.exe\\n\\nwireshark.exe\\n\\nwireshark-gtk.exe\\n\\ntcpview.exe\\n\\nFurthermore, the malware needs to locate the current updll3.dll3 on the system so its latest version can be stored in memory, removed from disk, and dropped just before another system restart. Two approaches are used to achieve this:\\n\\nReading eScan folder location from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\AVC3\\n\\nIf one of the checked processes is called download.exe , which is a legitimate eScan binary, it obtains the file location to discover the folder. The output can look like this: \\\\Device\\\\HarddiskVolume1\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\eScan\\\\download.exe\\n\\n, which is a legitimate eScan binary, it obtains the file location to discover the folder. The output can look like this:\\n\\nThe check for download.exe serves as an alternative for locating eScan installation folder and the code seems heavily inspired by the example code of Obtaining a File Name From a File handle on MSDN.\\n\\nFinally, Puppeteer also continuously monitors the CPU usage on the system and tweaks the core allocation in such a way it is not that much resource heavy and stays under the radar.\\n\\nBackdoor Setup\\n\\n4dfd082eee771b7801b2ddcea9680457f76d4888c64bb0b45d4ea616f0a47f21\\n\\n(2019-06-29 03:38:24 UTC)\\n\\nThe backdoor is set up by the previous stage, Puppeteer, by first discovering whether the machine is operating on a Windows Server or not. This is done by checking a DNS Server registry key (DNS Server service is typically running on a Windows Server edition):\\n\\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\DNS Server\\n\\nAfter that, the malware runs a command to check and get a number of computers joined in a domain:\\n\\nnet group “domain computers” /domain\\n\\nThe data printed by the net group command typically uses 25 characters per domain joined computer plus a newline ( CR+LF ) per every three computers, which can be illustrated by the example below:\\n\\nExample output of net group command\\n\\nIn this version of the backdoor setup, Puppeteer checks whether the number of returned bytes is more than 100. If so, Puppeteer assumes it runs in a network shared with at least five computers and downloads additional payloads from a hardcoded C&C ( https://m.airequipment[.]net/gpse/ ) and executes it using PowerShell command.\\n\\nNote that the threshold for the number of returned bytes was different and significantly higher in later versions of GuptiMiner, as can be seen in a dedicated section discussing Modular Backdoor, resulting in compromising only those networks which had more than 7000 computers joined in the same domain!\\n\\nIf the checks above pass, Puppeteer uses a PowerShell command for downloading and executing the payload and, interestingly, it is run both in the current process as well as injected in explorer.exe .\\n\\nFurthermore, regardless of whether the infected computer is present in a network of a certain size or not, it tries to download additional payload from dl.sneakerhost[.]com/u as well. This payload is yet another PNG file with the appended shellcode. We know this because the code uses the exact same parsing from the specific offset 0x325 of the PNG file as described in Stage 1. However, during our analysis, this domain was already taken down and we couldn’t verify what kind of payload was being distributed here.\\n\\nThe Puppeteer’s backdoor setup process was improved and tweaked multiple times during its long development. In the upcoming subsections, we will focus on more important changes, mostly those which influence other parts of the malware or present a whole new functionality.\\n\\nLater Puppeteer Versions\\n\\nIn later versions, the attackers switched to the datetime mutex paradigm (as illustrated in Mutexes in Time section) and also introduced additional process monitoring of more Sysinternals tools like Process explorer, Process monitor, as well as other tools like OllyDbg, WinDbg, and TeamViewer.\\n\\nPool Configuration\\n\\n487624b44b43dacb45fd93d03e25c9f6d919eaa6f01e365bb71897a385919ddd\\n\\n(2023-11-21 18:05:43 UTC)\\n\\nAdditionally, the GuptiMiner authors also started to modify pool addresses in XMRig configurations with a new approach. They started using subdomains by “ r ” and “ m ” depending on the available physical memory on the infected system. If there is at least 3 GB of RAM available, the malware uses:\\n\\nm.domain.tld with auto mode and enabled huge pages.\\n\\nIf the available RAM is lesser than 3 GB, it uses:\\n\\nr.domain.tld with light mode and disabled huge pages.\\n\\nIn order to not keep things simple, the authors later also started to use “ p ” as a subdomain in some versions, without any specific reason for the naming convention (perhaps just to say it is a “pool”).\\n\\nThe usage of all such domains in time can be seen in the Domains timeline.\\n\\nVariety in Used DLLs\\n\\nPuppeteer used many different names and locations of DLLs over the years for sideloading or directly loading using scheduled tasks. For example, these might be:\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\eScan\\\\updll3.dll3\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Common Files\\\\SYSTEM\\\\SysResetErr\\\\SysResetErr.DLL\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft SQL Server\\\\SpellChecking\\\\MsSpellChecking.DLL\\n\\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft SQL Server\\\\SpellChecking\\\\MsSpellCheckingHost.DLL\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\AMD\\\\CNext\\\\atiadlxx.dll\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Assistance\\\\LunarG\\\\vulkan-1.dll\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Crypto\\\\Escan\\\\updll3.dll\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Crypto\\\\Escan\\\\updll3.dll3\\n\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Network\\\\Escan\\\\AutoWake.dll\\n\\nPuppeteer Cleanup\\n\\n1c31d06cbdf961867ec788288b74bee0db7f07a75ae06d45d30355c0bc7b09fe\\n\\n(2020-03-09 00:57:11 UTC)\\n\\nWe’ve also seen “cleaner” Puppeteers, meaning they didn’t contain the setup process for backdoors, but they were able to delete the malicious DLLs from the system when a running monitoring tool was detected.\\n\\nDeploy Per-Quarter\\n\\n1fbc562b08637a111464ba182cd22b1286a185f7cfba143505b99b07313c97a4\\n\\n(2021-03-01 10:43:27 UTC)\\n\\nIn this particular version, the deployment of the backdoor was performed once every 3 months, indicating a per-quarter deployment.\\n\\nThe deployment happens at March, June, September, and December\\n\\nStage 4 – Backdoor\\n\\nSince no one who puts such an effort into a malware campaign deploys just coinminers on the infected devices, let’s dig deeper into additional sets of GuptiMiner’s functionalities – deploying two types of backdoors on the infected devices.\\n\\nPuTTY Backdoor\\n\\n07beca60c0a50520b8dbc0b8cc2d56614dd48fef0466f846a0a03afbfc42349d\\n\\n(2021-03-01 10:31:33 UTC)\\n\\nE:\\\\Projects\\\\putty-src\\\\windows\\\\VS2012\\\\x64\\\\Release\\\\plink.pdb\\n\\nOne of the backdoors deployed by GuptiMiner is based on a custom build of PuTTY Link ( plink ). This build contains an enhancement for local SMB network scanning, and it ultimately enables lateral movement over the network to potentially exploit Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 machines by tunneling SMB traffic through the victim’s infected device.\\n\\nLocal SMB Scanning\\n\\nFirst, the plink binary is injected into netsh.exe process by Puppeteer with the Deploy per-quarter approach. After a successful injection, the malware discovers local IP ranges by reading the IP tables from the victim’s device, adding those into local and global IP range lists.\\n\\nWith that, the malware continues with the local SMB scanning over the obtained IP ranges: xx.yy.zz.1-254 . When a device supporting SMB is discovered, it is saved in a dedicated list. The same goes with IPs that don’t support SMB, effectively deny listing them from future actions. This deny list is saved in specific registry subkeys named Sem and Init , in this location:\\n\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\CMF\\\\Class\\n\\nwhere Init contains the found IP addresses and Sem contains their total count.\\n\\nThere are conditions taking place when such a scan is performed. For example, the scan can happen only when it is a day in the week (!) , per-quarter deployment, and only at times between 12 PM and 18 PM. Here, we denoted by (!) a unique coding artefact in the condition, since checking the day of the week is not necessary (always true).\\n\\nQuestionable conditioning for SMB scanning\\n\\nFinally, the malware also creates a new registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\RNG\\\\FFFF three hours after a successful scan. This serves as a flag that the scanning should be finished, and no more scanning is needed.\\n\\nAn even more interesting datetime-related bug can be seen in a conditioning of RNG\\\\FFFF registry removal. The removal is done to indicate that the malware can perform another SMB scan after a certain period of time.\\n\\nAs we can see in the figure below, the malware obtains the write time of the registry key and the current system time by SystemTimeToVariantTime API function and subtracts those. The subtraction result is a floating-point number where the integral part means number of days.\\n\\nFurthermore, the malware uses a constant 60*60*60*24=5184000 seconds (60 days) in the condition for the registry key removal. However, the condition is comparing VariantTime (days) with seconds. Thus, the backdoor can activate every 51.84 days instead of the (intended?) 60 days. A true blessing in disguise.\\n\\nRemoval of RNG\\\\FFFF key, deploying the backdoor after 51.84 days\\n\\nLateral Movement Over SMB Traffic\\n\\nAfter the local SMB scan is finished, the malware checks from the received SMB packet results whether any of the IP addresses that responded are running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 . If any such a system is found on the local network, the malware adds these IP addresses to a list of potential targets.\\n\\nFurthermore, GuptiMiner executes the main() legacy function from plink with artificial parameters. This will create a tunnel on the port 445 between the attacker’s server gesucht[.]net and the victim’s device.\\n\\nParameters used for plink main() function\\n\\nThis tunnel is used for sending SMB traffic through the victim’s device to the IP addresses from the target list, enabling lateral movement over the local network.\\n\\nNote that this version of Puppeteer, deploying this backdoor, is from 2021. We also mentioned that only Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 are targeted, which are rather old. We think this might be because the attackers try to deploy an exploit for possible vulnerabilities on these old systems.\\n\\nTo orchestrate the SMB communication, the backdoor hand-crafts SMB packets on the fly by modifying TID and UID fields to reflect previous SMB communication. As shown in the decompiled code below, the SMB packet 4 , which is crafted and sent by the malware, contains both TID and UID from the responses of the local network device.\\n\\nThe backdoor hand-crafts SMB packets on the fly\\n\\nHere we provide an example how the SMB packets look like in Wireshark when sent by the malware. After the connection is established, the malware tries to login as anonymous and makes requests for \\\\IPC$ and a named pipe.\\n\\nSMB traffic captured by Wireshark\\n\\nInterested reader can find the captured PCAP on our GitHub.\\n\\nModular Backdoor\\n\\nf0ccfcb5d49d08e9e66b67bb3fedc476fdf5476a432306e78ddaaba4f8e3bbc4\\n\\n(2023-10-10 15:08:36 UTC)\\n\\nAnother backdoor that we’ve found during our research being distributed by Puppeteer is a modular backdoor which targets huge corporate networks. It consists of two phases – the malware scans the devices for the existence of locally stored private keys and cryptocurrency wallets, and the second part is an injected modular backdoor, in the form of a shellcode.\\n\\nChecks on Private Keys, Wallets, and Corporate Network\\n\\nThis part of the backdoor focuses on scanning for private keys and wallet files on the system. This is done by searching for .pvk and .wallet files in these locations:\\n\\nC:\\\\Users\\\\*\\n\\nD:\\\\*\\n\\nE:\\\\*\\n\\nF:\\\\*\\n\\nG:\\\\*\\n\\nIf there is such a file found in the system, its path is logged in a newly created file C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Ca.txt . Interestingly, this file is not processed on its own by the code we have available. We suppose the data will be stolen later when further modules are downloaded by the backdoor.\\n\\nThe fact that the scan was performed is marked by creating a registry key:\\n\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\DECLAG\\n\\nIf some private keys or wallets were found on the system or the malware is running in a huge corporate environment, the malware proceeds with injecting the backdoor, in a form of a shellcode, into the mmc.exe process.\\n\\nThe size of the corporate environment is guessed by the same approach as Puppeteer’s backdoor setup with the difference in the scale. Here, the malware compares the returned list of computers in the domain with 200,000 characters. To recapitulate, the data printed by the net group command uses 25 characters per domain joined computer plus a newline ( CR+LF ) per every three computers.\\n\\nExample output of net group command\\n\\nThis effectively means that the network in which the malware operates must have at least 7781 computers joined in the domain, which is quite a large number.\\n\\nBackdoor\\n\\n8446d4fc1310b31238f9a610cd25ea832925a25e758b9a41eea66f998163bb34\\n\\nThis shellcode is a completely different piece of code than what we’ve seen so far across GuptiMiner campaign. It is designed to be multi-modular with the capability of adding more modules into the execution flow. Only a networking communication module, however, is hardcoded and available by default, and its hash is 74d7f1af69fb706e87ff0116b8e4fa3a9b87275505e2ee7a32a8628a2d066549 (2022-12-19 07:31:39 UTC) .\\n\\nAfter the injection, the backdoor decrypts a hardcoded configuration and a hardcoded networking module using RC4. The RC4 key is also hardcoded and available directly in the shellcode.\\n\\nThe configuration contains details about which server to contact, what ports to use, the length of delays that should be set between commands/requests, among others. The domain for communication in this configuration is www.righttrak[.]net:443 and an IP address 185.248.160[.]141 .\\n\\nDecrypted network module configuration\\n\\nThe network module contains seven different commands that the attacker can use for instructing the backdoor about what to do. A complete list of commands accepted by the network module can be found in the table below. Note that each module that can be used by the backdoor contains such a command handler on its own.\\n\\nCommand Description 3.0 Connect 3.1 Read socket 3.2 Write socket 3.3 Close socket 4 Close everything 6 Return 1 12 Load configuration\\n\\nThe modules are stored in an encrypted form in the registry, ensuring their persistence:\\n\\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\PCB\\n\\nThe backdoor also uses an import by hash obfuscation for resolving API functions. The hashing function is a simple algorithm that takes each byte of the exported function name, adds 1 to it, and then multiplies the previously calculated number ( calculated_hash , starts with 0) by 131 and adds it to the byte:\\n\\nThe server www.righttrak[.]net:443 had, at the time, a valid certificate. Note for example the not-at-all-suspicious email address the authors used.\\n\\nCertificate on www.righttrak[.]net:443 as shown by Censys\\n\\nOther Infection Vectors of Modular Backdoor\\n\\naf9f1331ac671d241bf62240aa52389059b4071a0635cb9cb58fa78ab942a33b\\n\\nDuring our research, we have also found a 7zip SFX executable containing two files:\\n\\nms00.dat\\n\\nnotepad.exe\\n\\nnotepad.exe is a small binary that decrypts ms00.dat file using RC4 with a key V#@!1vw32 . The decrypted ms00.dat file is the same Modular Backdoor malware as described above.\\n\\nHowever, we have not seen this SFX executable being distributed by GuptiMiner. This indicates that this backdoor might be distributed by different infection vectors as well.\\n\\nRelated and Future Research\\n\\nWe’ve also observed other more or less related samples during our research.\\n\\nPowerShell Scripts\\n\\nInterestingly, we’ve found the C&C domain from the backdoor setup phase (in Puppeteer) in additional scripts as well which were not distributed by traditional GuptiMiner operation as we know it. We think this might be a different kind of attack sharing the GuptiMiner infrastructure, though it might be a different campaign. Formatted PowerShell script can be found below:\\n\\nA PowerShell script targeting eScan (formatted)\\n\\nIn this case, the payload is downloaded and executed from the malicious domain only when an antivirus is installed, and its name has more than 4 letters and starts with eS . One does not have to be a scrabble champion to figure out that the malware authors are targeting the eScan AV once again. The malicious code is also run when the name of the installed AV has less than 5 letters.\\n\\nWe’ve found this script being run via a scheduled task with a used command:\\n\\n\"cmd.exe\" /c type \"\\\\<domain>\\\\SYSVOL\\\\<domain>\\\\scripts\\\\gpon.inc\" | \"\\\\<domain>\\\\SYSVOL\\\\<domain>\\\\scripts\\\\powAMD64.dat\" -nop -\\n\\nwhere powAMD64.dat is a copy of powershell.exe . The task name and location was C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\Tasks\\\\ScheduledDefrag\\n\\nUsage of Stolen Certificates\\n\\nWe have found two stolen certificates used for signing GuptiMiner payloads. Interestingly, one of the used stolen certificates originates in Winnti operations. In this particular sample, the digital signature has a hash:\\n\\n529763AC53562BE3C1BB2C42BCAB51E3AD8F8A56\\n\\nThis certificate is the same as mentioned by Kaspersky more than 10 years ago. However, we’ve also seen this certificate to be used in multiple malware samples than just GuptiMiner, though, indicating a broader leak.\\n\\nA complete list of stolen certificates and their usage can be found in the table below:\\n\\nStolen certificate SHA1 Signed GuptiMiner sample 529763AC53562BE3C1BB2C42BCAB51E3AD8F8A56 31dfba1b102bbf4092b25e63aae0f27386c480c10191c96c04295cb284f20878 529763AC53562BE3C1BB2C42BCAB51E3AD8F8A56 8e96d15864ec0cc6d3976d87e9e76e6eeccc23c551b22dcfacb60232773ec049 31070C2EA30E6B4E1C270DF94BE1036AE7F8616B b0f94d84888dffacbc10bd7f9983b2d681b55d7e932c2d952d47ee606058df54 31070C2EA30E6B4E1C270DF94BE1036AE7F8616B f656a418fca7c4275f2441840faaeb70947e4f39d3826d6d2e50a3e7b8120e4e\\n\\nPossible Ties to Kimsuky\\n\\n7f1221c613b9de2da62da613b8b7c9afde2ea026fe6b88198a65c9485ded7b3d\\n\\n(2021-03-06 20:13:32 UTC)\\n\\nDuring our research, we’ve also found an information stealer which holds a rather similar PDB path as was used across the whole GuptiMiner campaign ( MainWork ):\\n\\nF:\\\\!PROTECT\\\\Real\\\\startW-2008\\\\MainWork\\\\Release\\\\MainWork.pdb\\n\\nHowever, we haven’t seen it distributed by GuptiMiner and, according to our data, it doesn’t belong to the same operation and infection chain. This malware performs stealing activities like capturing every keystroke, harvesting HTML forms from opened browser tabs, noting times of opened programs, etc., and stores them in log files.\\n\\nWhat is truly interesting, however, is that this information stealer might come from Kimsuky operations. Also known as Black Banshee, among other aliases, Kimsuky is a North Korean state-backed APT group.\\n\\nIt contains the similar approach of searching for AhnLab real-time detection window class name 49B46336-BA4D-4905-9824-D282F05F6576 as mentioned by both AhnLab as well as Cisco Talos Intelligence in their Information-gathering module section. If such a window is found, it will be terminated/hidden from the view of the infected user.\\n\\nFunction that searches and terminates AhnLab’s real-time detection window class\\n\\nFurthermore, the stealer contains an encrypted payload in resources, having a hash: d5bc6cf988c6d3c60e71195d8a5c2f7525f633bb54059688ad8cfa1d4b72aa6c (2021-02-19 19.02.2021 15:00:47 UTC) and it has this PDB path:\\n\\nF:\\\\PROTECT\\\\Real\\\\startW-2008\\\\HTTPPro\\\\Release\\\\HTTPPro.pdb\\n\\nThis module is decrypted using the standard RC4 algorithm with the key messi.com . The module is used for downloading additional stages. One of the used URLs are:\\n\\nhttp://stwu.mygamesonline[.]org/home/sel.php\\n\\nhttp://stwu.mygamesonline[.]org/home/buy.php?filename=%s&key=%s\\n\\nThe domain mygamesonline[.]org is commonly used by Kimsuky (with variety of subdomains).\\n\\nThe keylogger also downloads next stage called ms12.acm :\\n\\nThe next stage is downloaded with a name ms12.acm\\n\\nWith this, we see a possible pattern with the naming convention and a link to Modular Backdoor. As described in the Other Infection Vectors section, the 7z SFX archive contains an encrypted file called ms00.dat with which we struggle to ignore the resemblance.\\n\\nLast but not least, another strong indicator for a possible attribution is the fact that the Kimsuky keylogger sample dddc57299857e6ecb2b80cbab2ae6f1978e89c4bfe664c7607129b0fc8db8b1f , which is mentioned in the same blogpost from Talos, contains a section called .vlizer , as seen below:\\n\\nKimsuky keylogger sections\\n\\nDuring the GuptiMiner installation process (Stage 0), we wrote about the threat actors introducing Code Virtualization in 2018. This was done by using a dedicated section called .v_lizer .\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this analysis, we described our findings regarding a long-standing threat we called GuptiMiner, in detail. This sophisticated operation has been performing MitM attacks targeting an update mechanism of the eScan antivirus vendor. We disclosed the security vulnerability to both eScan and the India CERT and received confirmation on 2023-07-31 from eScan that the issue was fixed and successfully resolved.\\n\\nDuring the GuptiMiner operation, the attackers were deploying a wide chain of stages and functionalities, including performing DNS requests to the attacker’s DNS servers, sideloading, extracting payloads from innocent-looking images, signing its payloads with a custom trusted root anchor certification authority, among others.\\n\\nTwo different types of backdoors were discovered, targeting large corporate networks. The first provided SMB scanning of the local network, enabling lateral movement over the network to potentially exploit vulnerable Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 systems on the network. The second backdoor is multi-modular, accepting commands on background to install more modules as well as focusing on stealing stored private keys and cryptowallets.\\n\\nInterestingly, the final payload distributed by GuptiMiner was also XMRig which is a bit unexpected for such a thought-through operation.\\n\\nWe have also found possible ties to Kimsuky, a notorious North Korean APT group, while observing similarities between Kimsuky keylogger and fragments discovered during the analysis of the GuptiMiner operation.\\n\\neScan follow-up\\n\\nWe have shared our findings and our research with eScan prior to publishing this analysis. For the sake of completeness, we are including their statement on this topic:\\n\\n“I would also like to highlight some key points:\\n\\n1. Our records indicate that the last similar report was received towards the end of the year 2019.\\n\\n2. Since 2020, we have implemented a stringent checking mechanism that utilizes EV Signing to ensure that non-signed binaries are rejected.\\n\\n3. Multiple heuristic rules have been integrated into our solution to detect and block any instances of legitimate processes being used for mining, including the forking of unsigned binaries.\\n\\n4. While our internal investigations did not uncover instances of the XRig miner, it is possible that this may be due to geo-location factors.\\n\\n5. Our latest solution versions employ secure (https) downloads, ensuring encrypted communication when clients interact with our cloud-facing servers for update downloads.”\\n\\nAccording to our telemetry, we continue to observe new infections and GuptiMiner builds within our userbase. This may be attributable to eScan clients on these devices not being updated properly.\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\\n\\nIn this section, we would like to summarize the Indicators of Compromise mentioned in this analysis. As they are indicators, it doesn’t automatically mean the mentioned files and/or domains are malicious on their own.\\n\\nFor more detailed list of IoCs of the whole GuptiMiner campaign, please visit

Avast found a previously undocumented Kaolin RAT, where it could aside from standard RAT functionality, change the last write timestamp of a selected file and load any received DLL binary from C&C server. We also believe it was loading FudModule along with a 0-day exploit.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn the summer of 2023, Avast identified a campaign targeting specific individuals in the Asian region through fabricated job offers. The motivation behind the attack remains uncertain, but judging from the low frequency of attacks, it appears that the attacker had a special interest in individuals with technical backgrounds. This sophistication is evident from previous research where the Lazarus group exploited vulnerable drivers and performed several rootkit techniques to effectively blind security products and achieve better persistence.\\n\\nIn this instance, Lazarus sought to blind security products by exploiting a vulnerability in the default Windows driver, appid.sys (CVE-2024-21338). More information about this vulnerability can be found in a corresponding blog post.\\n\\nThis indicates that Lazarus likely allocated additional resources to develop such attacks. Prior to exploitation, Lazarus deployed the toolset meticulously, employing fileless malware and encrypting the arsenal onto the hard drive, as detailed later in this blog post.\\n\\nFurthermore, the nature of the attack suggests that the victim was carefully selected and highly targeted, as there likely needed to be some level of rapport established with the victim before executing the initial binary. Deploying such a sophisticated toolset alongside the exploit indicates considerable resourcefulness.\\n\\nThis blog post will present a technical analysis of each module within the entire attack chain. This analysis aims to establish connections between the toolset arsenal used by the Lazarus group and previously published research.\\n\\nInitial access\\n\\nThe attacker initiates the attack by presenting a fabricated job offer to an unsuspecting individual, utilizing social engineering techniques to establish contact and build rapport. While the specific communication platform remains unknown, previous research by Mandiant and ESET suggests potential delivery vectors may include LinkedIn, WhatsApp, email or other platforms. Subsequently, the attacker attempts to send a malicious ISO file, disguised as VNC tool, which is a part of the interviewing process. The choice of an ISO file is starting to be very attractive for attackers because, from Windows 10, an ISO file could be automatically mounted just by double clicking and the operating system will make the ISO content easily accessible. This may also serve as a potential Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) bypass.\\n\\nSince the attacker created rapport with the victim, the victim is tricked by the attacker to mount the ISO file, which contains three files: AmazonVNC.exe , version.dl l and aws.cfg . This leads the victim to execute AmazonVNC.exe .\\n\\nThe AmazonVNC.exe executable only pretends to be the Amazon VNC client, instead, it is a legitimate Windows application called choice.exe that ordinarily resides in the System32 folder. This executable is used for sideloading, to load the malicious version.dll through the legitimate choice.exe application. Sideloading is a popular technique among attackers for evading detection since the malicious DLL is executed in the context of a legitimate application.\\n\\nWhen AmazonVNC.exe gets executed, it loads version.dll . This malicious DLL is using native Windows API functions in an attempt to avoid defensive techniques such as user-mode API hooks. All native API functions are invoked by direct syscalls. The malicious functionality is implemented in one of the exported functions and not in DLL Main. There is no code in DLLMain it just returns 1, and in the other exported functions is just Sleep functionality.\\n\\nAfter the DLL obtains the correct syscall numbers for the current Windows version, it is ready to spawn an iexpress.exe process to host a further malicious payload that resides in the third file, aws.cfg . Injection is performed only if the Kaspersky antivirus is installed on the victim’s computer, which seems to be done to evade Kaspersky detection. If Kaspersky is not installed, the malware executes the payload by creating a thread in the current process, with no injection. The aws.cfg file, which is the next stage payload, is obfuscated by VMProtect, perhaps in an effort to make reverse engineering more difficult. The payload is capable of downloading shellcode from a Command and Control (C&C) server, which we believe is a legitimate hacked website selling marble material for construction. The official website is https://www[.]henraux.com/ , and the attacker was able to download shellcode from https://www[.]henraux.com/sitemaps/about/about.asp\\n\\nIn detailing our findings, we faced challenges extracting a shellcode from the C&C server as the malicious URL was unresponsive.\\n\\nBy analyzing our telemetry, we uncovered potential threats in one of our clients, indicating a significant correlation between the loading of shellcode from the C&C server via an ISO file and the subsequent appearance of the RollFling , which is a new undocumented loader that we discovered and will delve into later in this blog post.\\n\\nMoreover, the delivery method of the ISO file exhibits tactical similarities to those employed by the Lazarus group, a fact previously noted by researchers from Mandiant and ESET.\\n\\nIn addition, a RollSling sample was identified on the victim machines, displaying code similarities with the RollSling sample discussed in Microsoft’s research. Notably, the RollSling instance discovered in our client’s environment was delivered by the RollFling loader, confirming our belief in the connection between the absent shellcode and the initial loader RollFling . For visual confirmation, refer to the first screenshot showcasing the SHA of RollSling report code from Microsoft, while on the second screenshot is the code derived from our RollSling sample.\\n\\nImage illustrates the RollSling code identified by Microsoft. SHA:\\n\\nd9add2bfdfebfa235575687de356f0cefb3e4c55964c4cb8bfdcdc58294eeaca .\\n\\nImage showcases the RollSling code discovered within our targe. SHA: 68ff1087c45a1711c3037dad427733ccb1211634d070b03cb3a3c7e836d210f . In the next paragraphs, we are going to explain every component in the execution chain, starting with the initial RollFling loader, continuing with the subsequently loaded RollSling loader, and then the final RollMid loader. Finally, we will analyze the Kaolin RAT, which is ultimately loaded by the chain of these three loaders.\\n\\nLoaders\\n\\nRollFling\\n\\nThe RollFling loader is a malicious DLL that is established as a service, indicating the attacker’s initial attempt at achieving persistence by registering as a service. Accompanying this RollFling loader are essential files crucial for the consistent execution of the attack chain. Its primary role is to kickstart the execution chain, where all subsequent stages operate exclusively in memory. Unfortunately, we were unable to ascertain whether the DLL file was installed as a service with administrator rights or just with standard user rights.\\n\\nThe loader acquires the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) table by utilizing the Windows API function GetSystemFirmwareTable . Beginning with Windows 10, version 1803, any user mode application can access SMBIOS information. SMBIOS serves as the primary standard for delivering management information through system firmware.\\n\\nBy calling the GetSystemFirmwareTable (see Figure 1.) function, SMBIOSTableData is retrieved, and that SMBIOSTableData is used as a key for decrypting the encrypted RollSling loader by using the XOR operation. Without the correct SMBIOSTableData , which is a 32-byte-long key, the RollSling decryption process would be ineffective so the execution of the malware would not proceed to the next stage. This suggests a highly targeted attack aimed at a specific individual.\\n\\nThis suggests that prior to the attacker establishing persistence by registering the RollFling loader as a service, they had to gather information about the SMBIOS table and transmit it to the C&C server. Subsequently, the C&C server could then reply with another stage. This additional stage, called RollSling , is stored in the same folder as RollFling but with the \".nls\" extension.\\n\\nAfter successful XOR decryption of RollSling , RollFling is now ready to load decrypted RollSling into memory and continue with the execution of RollSling .\\n\\nFigure 1: Obtaining SMBIOS firmware table provider\\n\\nRollSling\\n\\nThe RollSling loader, initiated by RollFling , is executed in memory. This choice may help the attacker evade detection by security software. The primary function of RollSling is to locate a binary blob situated in the same folder as RollSling (or in the Package Cache folder). If the binary blob is not situated in the same folder as the RollSling , then the loader will look in the Package Cache folder. This binary blob holds various stages and configuration data essential for the malicious functionality. This binary blob must have been uploaded to the victim machine by some previous stage in the infection chain.\\n\\nThe reasoning behind binary blob holding multiple files and configuration values is twofold. Firstly, it is more efficient to hold all the information in a single file and, secondly, most of the binary blob can be encrypted, which may add another layer of evasion meaning lowering the chance of detection.\\n\\nRollsling is scanning the current folder, where it is looking for a specific binary blob. To determine which binary blob in the current folder is the right one, it first reads 4 bytes to determine the size of the data to read. Once the data is read, the bytes from the binary blob are reversed and saved in a temporary variable, afterwards, it goes through several conditions checks like the MZ header check. If the MZ header check is done, subsequently it looks for the “StartAction” export function from the extracted binary. If all conditions are met, then it will load the next stage RollMid in memory. The attackers in this case didn’t use any specific file name for a binary blob or any specific extension, to be able to easily find the binary blob in the folder. Instead, they have determined the right binary blob through several conditions, that binary blob had to meet. This is also one of the defensive evasion techniques for attackers to make it harder for defenders to find the binary blob in the infected machine.\\n\\nThis stage represents the next stage in the execution chain, which is the third loader called RollMid which is also executed in the computer’s memory.\\n\\nBefore the execution of the RollMid loader, the malware creates two folders, named in the following way:\\n\\n%driveLetter%:\\\\\\\\ProgramData\\\\\\\\Package Cache\\\\\\\\[0-9A-Z]{8}-DF09-AA86-YI78-[0-9A-Z]{12}\\\\\\\\\\n\\n%driveLetter%:\\\\\\\\ProgramData\\\\\\\\Package Cache\\\\\\\\ [0-9A-Z]{8}-09C7-886E-II7F-[0-9A-Z]{12}\\\\\\\\\\n\\nThese folders serve as destinations for moving the binary blob, now renamed with a newly generated name and a \".cab\" extension. RollSling loader will store the binary blob in the first created folder, and it will store a new temporary file, whose usage will be mentioned later, in the second created folder.\\n\\nThe attacker utilizes the \"Package Cache\" folder, a common repository for software installation files, to better hide its malicious files in a folder full of legitimate files. In this approach, the attacker also leverages the \".cab\" extension, which is the usual extension for the files located in the Package Cache folder. By employing this method, the attacker is trying to effectively avoid detection by relocating essential files to a trusted folder.\\n\\nIn the end, the RollSling loader calls an exported function called \"StartAction\" . This function is called with specific arguments, including information about the actual path of the RollFling loader, the path where the binary blob resides, and the path of a temporary file to be created by the RollMid loader.\\n\\nFigure 2: Looking for a binary blob in the same folder as the RollFling loader\\n\\nRollMid\\n\\nThe responsibility of the RollMid loader lies in loading key components of the attack and configuration data from the binary blob, while also establishing communication with a C&C server.\\n\\nThe binary blob, containing essential components and configuration data, serves as a critical element in the proper execution of the attack chain. Unfortunately, our attempts to obtain this binary blob were unsuccessful, leading to gaps in our full understanding of the attack. However, we were able to retrieve the RollMid loader and certain binaries stored in memory.\\n\\nWithin the binary blob, the RollMid loader is a fundamental component located at the beginning (see Figure 3). The first 4 bytes in the binary blob describe the size of the RollMid loader. There are two more binaries stored in the binary blob after the RollMid loader as well as configuration data, which is located at the very end of the binary blob. These two other binaries and configuration data are additionally subject to compression and AES encryption, adding layers of security to the stored information.\\n\\nAs depicted, the first four bytes enclosed in the initial yellow box describe the size of the RollMid loader. This specific information is also important for parsing, enabling the transition to the subsequent section within the binary blob.\\n\\nLocated after the RollMid loader, there are two 4-byte values, distinguished by yellow and green colors. The former corresponds to the size of FIRST_ENCRYPTED_DLL section, while the latter (green box) signifies the size of SECOND_ENCRYPTED_DLL section. Notably, the second 4-byte value in the green box serves a dual purpose, not only describing a size but also at the same time constituting a part of the 16-byte AES key for decrypting the FIRST_ENCRYPTED_DLL section. Thanks to the provided information on the sizes of each encrypted DLL embedded in the binary blob, we are now equipped to access the configuration data section placed at the end of the binary blob.\\n\\nFigure 3: Structure of the Binary blob\\n\\nThe RollMid loader requires the FIRST_DLL_BINARY for proper communication with the C&C server. However, before loading FIRST_DLL_BINARY , the RollMid loader must first decrypt the FIRST_ENCRYPTED_DLL section.\\n\\nThe decryption process applies the AES algorithm, beginning with the parsing of the decryption key alongside an initialization vector to use for AES decryption. Subsequently, a decompression algorithm is applied to further extract the decrypted content. Following this, the decrypted FIRST_DLL_BINARY is loaded into memory, and the DllMain function is invoked to initialize the networking library.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as we were unable to obtain the binary blob, we didn’t get a chance to reverse engineer the FIRST_DLL_BINARY . This presents a limitation in our understanding, as the precise implementation details for the imported functions in the RollMid loader remain unknown. These imported functions include the following:\\n\\nSendDataFromUrl\\n\\nGetImageFromUrl\\n\\nGetHtmlFromUrl\\n\\ncurl_global_cleanup\\n\\ncurl_global_init\\n\\nAfter reviewing the exported functions by their names, it becomes apparent that these functions are likely tasked with facilitating communication with the C&C server. FIRST_DLL_BINARY also exports other functions beyond these five, some of which will be mentioned later in this blog.\\n\\nThe names of these five imported functions imply that FIRST_DLL_BINARY is built upon the curl library (as can be seen by the names curl_global_cleanup and curl_global_init ). In order to establish communication with the C&C servers, the RollMid loader employs the imported functions, utilizing HTTP requests as its preferred method of communication.\\n\\nThe rationale behind opting for the curl library for sending HTTP requests may stem from various factors. One notable reason could be the efficiency gained by the attacker, who can save time and resources by leveraging the HTTP communication protocol. Additionally, the ease of use and seamless integration of the curl library into the code further support its selection.\\n\\nPrior to initiating communication with the C&C server, the malware is required to generate a dictionary filled with random words, as illustrated in Figure 4 below. Given the extensive size of the dictionary (which contains approximately hundreds of elements), we have included only a partial screenshot for reference purposes. The subsequent sections of this blog will delve into a comprehensive exploration of the role and application of this dictionary in the overall functionality of malware.\\n\\nFigure 4: Filling the main dictionary\\n\\nTo establish communication with the C&C server, as illustrated in Figure 5, the malware must obtain the initial C&C addresses from the CONFIGURATION_DATA section. Upon decrypting these addresses, the malware initiates communication with the first layer of the C&C server through the GetHtmlFromUrl function, presumably using an HTTP GET request. The server responds with an HTML file containing the address of the second C&C server layer. Subsequently, the malware engages in communication with the second layer, employing the imported GetImageFromUrl function. The function name implies this performs a GET request to retrieve an image.\\n\\nIn this scenario, the attackers employ steganography to conceal crucial data for use in the next execution phase. Regrettably, we were unable to ascertain the nature of the important data concealed within the image received from the second layer of the C&C server.\\n\\nFigure 5: Communication with C&C servers\\n\\nWe are aware that the concealed data within the image serves as a parameter for a function responsible for transmitting data to the third C&C server. Through our analysis, we have determined that the acquired data from the image corresponds to another address of the third C&C server. Communication with the third C&C server is initiated with a POST request.\\n\\nMalware authors strategically employ multiple C&C servers as part of their operational tactics to achieve specific objectives. In this case, the primary goal is to obtain an additional data blob from the third C&C server, as depicted in Figure 5, specifically in step 7. Furthermore, the use of different C&C servers and diverse communication pathways adds an additional layer of complexity for security tools attempting to monitor such activities. This complexity makes tracking and identifying malicious activities more challenging, as compared to scenarios where a single C&C server is employed.\\n\\nThe malware then constructs a URL, by creating the query string with GET parameters (name/value pairs). The parameter name consists of a randomly selected word from the previously created dictionary and the value is generated as a random string of two characters. The format is as follows:\\n\\n\"%addressOfThirdC&C%?%RandomWordFromDictonary%=%RandomString%\"\\n\\nThe URL generation involves the selection of words from a generated dictionary, as opposed to entirely random strings. This intended choice aims to enhance the appearance and legitimacy of the URL. The words, carefully curated from the dictionary, contribute to the appearance of a clean and organized URL, resembling those commonly associated with authentic applications. The terms such as \"atype\" , \"User\" ,” or \"type\" are not arbitrary but rather thoughtfully chosen words from the created dictionary. By utilizing real words, the intention is to create a semblance of authenticity, making the HTTP POST payload appear more structured and in line with typical application interactions.\\n\\nBefore dispatching the POST request to the third layer of the C&C server, the request is populated with additional key-value tuples separated by standard delimiters “?” and “=” between the key and value. In this scenario, it includes:\\n\\n%RandomWordFromDictonary %=%sleep_state_in_minutes%?%size_of_configuration_data%\\n\\nThe data received from the third C&C server is parsed. The parsed data may contain an integer, describing sleep interval, or a data blob. This data blob is encoded using the base64 algorithm. After decoding the data blob, where the first 4 bytes indicate the size of the first part of the data blob, the remainder represents the second part of the data blob.\\n\\nThe first part of the data blob is appended to the SECOND_ENCRYPTED_DLL as an overlay, obtained from the binary blob. After successfully decrypting and decompressing SECOND_ENCRYPTED_DLL , the process involves preparing the SECOND_ENCRYPTED_DLL , which is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component to be loaded into memory and executed with the specific parameters.\\n\\nThe underlying motivation behind this maneuver remains shrouded in uncertainty. It appears that the attacker, by choosing this method, sought to inject a degree of sophistication or complexity into the process. However, from our perspective, this approach seems to border on overkill. We believe that a simpler method could have sufficed for passing the data blob to the Kaolin RAT.\\n\\nThe second part of the data blob, once decrypted and decompressed, is handed over to the Kaolin RAT component, while the Kaolin RAT is executed in memory. Notably, the decryption key and initialization vector for decrypting the second part of the data blob reside within its initial 32 bytes.\\n\\nKaolin RAT\\n\\nA pivotal phase in orchestrating the attack involves the utilization of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). As mentioned earlier, this Kaolin RAT is executed in memory and configured with specific parameters for proper functionality. It stands as a fully equipped tool, including file compression capabilities.\\n\\nHowever, in our investigation, the Kaolin RAT does not mark the conclusion of the attack. In the previous blog post, we already introduced another significant component – the FudModule rootkit. Thanks to our robust telemetry, we can confidently assert that this rootkit was loaded by the aforementioned Kaolin RAT, showcasing its capabilities to seamlessly integrate and deploy FudModule . This layered progression underscores the complexity and sophistication of the overall attack strategy.\\n\\nOne of the important steps is establishing secure communication with the RAT’s C&C server, encrypted using the AES encryption algorithm. Despite the unavailability of the binary containing the communication functionalities (the RAT also relies on functions imported from FIRST_DLL_BINARY for networking), our understanding is informed by other components in the attack chain, allowing us to make certain assumptions about the communication method.\\n\\nThe Kaolin RAT is loaded with six arguments, among which a key one is the base address of the network module DLL binary, previously also used in the RollMid loader. Another argument includes the configuration data from the second part of the received data blob.\\n\\nFor proper execution, the Kaolin RAT needs to parse this configuration data, which includes parameters such as:\\n\\nDuration of the sleep interval.\\n\\nA flag indicating whether to collect information about available disk drives.\\n\\nA flag indicating whether to retrieve a list of active sessions on the remote desktop.\\n\\nAddresses of additional C&C servers.\\n\\nIn addition, the Kaolin RAT must load specific functions from FIRST_DLL_BINARY , namely:\\n\\nSendDataFromURL\\n\\nZipFolder\\n\\nUnzipStr\\n\\ncurl_global_cleanup\\n\\ncurl_global_init\\n\\nAlthough the exact method by which the Kaolin RAT sends gathered information to the C&C server is not precisely known, the presence of exported functions like \"curl_global_cleanup\" and \"curl_global_init\" suggests that the sending process involves again API calls from the curl library.\\n\\nFor establishing communication, the Kaolin RAT begins by sending a POST request to the C&C server. In this first POST request, the malware constructs a URL containing the address of the C&C server. This URL generation algorithm is very similar to the one used in the RollMid loader. To the C&C address, the Kaolin RAT appends a randomly chosen word from the previously created dictionary (the same one as in the RollMid loader) along with a randomly generated string. The format of the URL is as follows:\\n\\n\"%addressOfC&Cserver%?%RandomWordFromDictonary%=%RandomString%\"\\n\\nThe malware further populates the content of the POST request, utilizing the default \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" content type. The content of the POST request is subject to AES encryption and subsequently encoded with base64.\\n\\nWithin the encrypted content, which is appended to the key-value tuples (see the form below), the following data is included (EncryptedContent) :\\n\\nInstallation path of the RollFling loader and path to the binary blob\\n\\nloader and path to the binary blob Data from the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Windows\\\\Iconservice\\n\\nKaolin RAT process ID\\n\\nRAT process ID Product name and build number of the operating system.\\n\\nAddresses of C&C servers.\\n\\nComputer name\\n\\nCurrent directory\\n\\nIn the POST request with the encrypted content, the malware appends information about the generated key and initialization vector necessary for decrypting data on the backend. This is achieved by creating key-value tuples, separated by “&” and “=” between the key and value.

It is evident that they invested significant resources in developing such a complex attack chain. What is certain is that Lazarus had to innovate continuously and allocate enormous resources to research various aspects of Windows mitigations and security products.

Microsoft’s security servicing criteria have long asserted that “[a]dministrator-to-kernel is not a security boundary”, meaning that Microsoft reserves the right to patch admin-to-kernel vulnerabilities at its own discretion. As a result, the Windows security model does not guarantee that it will prevent an admin-level attacker from directly accessing the kernel. This isn’t just a theoretical concern. In practice, attackers with admin privileges frequently achieve kernel-level access by exploiting known vulnerable drivers, in a technique called BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver).\\n\\nMicrosoft hasn’t given up on securing the admin-to-kernel boundary though. Quite the opposite, it has made a great deal of progress in making this boundary harder to cross. Defense-in-depth protections, such as DSE (Driver Signature Enforcement) or HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity), have made it increasingly difficult for attackers to execute custom code in the kernel, forcing most to resort to data-only attacks (where they achieve their malicious objectives solely by reading and writing kernel memory). Other defenses, such as driver blocklisting, are pushing attackers to move to exploiting less-known vulnerable drivers, resulting in an increase in attack complexity. Although these defenses haven’t yet reached the point where we can officially call admin-to-kernel a security boundary (BYOVD attacks are still feasible, so calling it one would just mislead users into a false sense of security), they clearly represent steps in the right direction.\\n\\nFrom the attacker’s perspective, crossing from admin to kernel opens a whole new realm of possibilities. With kernel-level access, an attacker might disrupt security software, conceal indicators of infection (including files, network activity, processes, etc.), disable kernel-mode telemetry, turn off mitigations, and more. Additionally, as the security of PPL (Protected Process Light) relies on the admin-to-kernel boundary, our hypothetical attacker also gains the ability to tamper with protected processes or add protection to an arbitrary process. This can be especially powerful if lsass is protected with RunAsPPL as bypassing PPL could enable the attacker to dump otherwise unreachable credentials.\\n\\nFor more specific examples of what an attacker might want to achieve with kernel-level access, keep reading this blog – in the latter half, we will dive into all the techniques implemented in the FudModule rootkit.\\n\\nLiving Off the Land: Vulnerable Drivers Edition\\n\\nWith a seemingly growing number of attackers seeking to abuse some of the previously mentioned kernel capabilities, defenders have no choice but to hunt heavily for driver exploits. Consequently, attackers wishing to target well-defended networks must also step up their game if they wish to avoid detection. We can broadly break down admin-to-kernel driver exploits into three categories, each representing a trade-off between attack difficulty and stealth.\\n\\nN-Day BYOVD Exploits\\n\\nIn the simplest case, an attacker can leverage BYOVD to exploit a publicly known n-day vulnerability. This is very easy to pull off, as there are plenty of public proof-of-concept exploits for various vulnerabilities. However, it’s also relatively straightforward to detect since the attacker must first drop a known vulnerable driver to the file system and then load it into the kernel, resulting in two great detection opportunities. What’s more, some systems may have Microsoft’s vulnerable driver blocklist enabled, which would block some of the most common vulnerable drivers from loading. Previous versions of the FudModule rootkit could be placed in this category, initially exploiting a known vulnerability in dbutil_2_3.sys and then moving on to targeting ene.sys in later versions.\\n\\nZero-Day BYOVD Exploits\\n\\nIn more sophisticated scenarios, an attacker would use BYOVD to exploit a zero-day vulnerability within a signed third-party driver. Naturally, this requires the attacker to first discover such a zero-day vulnerability, which might initially seem like a daunting task. However, note that any exploitable vulnerability in any signed driver will do, and there is unfortunately no shortage of low-quality third-party drivers. Therefore, the difficulty level of discovering such a vulnerability might not be as high as it would initially seem. It might suffice to scan a collection of drivers for known vulnerability patterns, as demonstrated by Carbon Black researchers who recently used bulk static analysis to uncover 34 unique vulnerabilities across more than 200 signed drivers. Such zero-day BYOVD attacks are notably stealthier than n-day attacks since defenders can no longer rely on hashes of known vulnerable drivers for detection. However, some detection opportunities still remain, as loading a random driver represents a suspicious event that might warrant deeper investigation. For an example of an attack belonging to this category, consider the spyware vendor Candiru, which we caught exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in hw.sys for the final privilege escalation stage of their browser exploit chain.\\n\\nBeyond BYOVD\\n\\nFinally, the holy grail of admin-to-kernel is going beyond BYOVD by exploiting a zero-day in a driver that’s known to be already installed on the target machine. To make the attack as universal as possible, the most obvious target here would be a built-in Windows driver that’s already a part of the operating system.\\n\\nDiscovering an exploitable vulnerability in such a driver is significantly more challenging than in the previous BYOVD scenarios for two reasons. First, the number of possible target drivers is vastly smaller, resulting in a much-reduced attack surface. Second, the code quality of built-in drivers is arguably higher than that of random third-party drivers, making vulnerabilities much more difficult to find. It’s also worth noting that – while patching tends to be ineffective at stopping BYOVD attacks (even if a vendor patches their driver, the attacker can still abuse the older, unpatched version of the driver) – patching a built-in driver will make the vulnerability no longer usable for this kind of zero-day attacks.\\n\\nIf an attacker, despite all of these hurdles, manages to exploit a zero-day vulnerability in a built-in driver, they will be rewarded with a level of stealth that cannot be matched by standard BYOVD exploitation. By exploiting such a vulnerability, the attacker is in a sense living off the land with no need to bring, drop, or load any custom drivers, making it possible for a kernel attack to be truly fileless. This not only evades most detection mechanisms but also enables the attack on systems where driver allowlisting is in place (which might seem a bit ironic, given that CVE-2024-21338 concerns an AppLocker driver).\\n\\nWhile we can only speculate on Lazarus’ motivation for choosing this third approach for crossing the admin-to-kernel boundary, we believe that stealth was their primary motivation. Given their level of notoriety, they would have to swap vulnerabilities any time someone burned their currently used BYOVD technique. Perhaps they also reasoned that, by going beyond BYOVD, they could minimize the need for swapping by staying undetected for longer.\\n\\nCVE-2024-21338\\n\\nAs far as zero-days go, CVE-2024-21338 is relatively straightforward to both understand and exploit. The vulnerability resides within the IOCTL (Input and Output Control) dispatcher in appid.sys , which is the central driver behind AppLocker, the application whitelisting technology built into Windows. The vulnerable control code 0x22A018 is designed to compute a smart hash of an executable image file. This IOCTL offers some flexibility by allowing the caller to specify how the driver should query and read the hashed file. The problem is, this flexibility is achieved by expecting two kernel function pointers referenced from the IOCTL’s input buffer: one containing a callback pointer to query the hashed file’s size and the other a callback pointer to read the data to be hashed.\\n\\nSince user mode would typically not be handling kernel function pointers, this design suggests the IOCTL may have been initially designed to be invoked from the kernel. Indeed, while we did not find any legitimate user-mode callers, the IOCTL does get invoked by other AppLocker drivers. For instance, there is a ZwDeviceIoControlFile call in applockerfltr.sys , passing SmpQueryFile and SmpReadFile for the callback pointers. Aside from that, appid.sys itself also uses this functionality, passing AipQueryFileHandle and AipReadFileHandle (which are basically just wrappers over ZwQueryInformationFile and ZwReadFile , respectively).\\n\\nDespite this design, the vulnerable IOCTL remained accessible from user space, meaning that a user-space attacker could abuse it to essentially trick the kernel into calling an arbitrary pointer. What’s more, the attacker also partially controlled the data referenced by the first argument passed to the invoked callback function. This presented an ideal exploitation scenario, allowing the attacker to call an arbitrary kernel function with a high degree of control over the first argument.\\n\\nA WinDbg session with the triggered vulnerability, traced to the arbitrary callback invocation. Note that the attacker controls both the function pointer to be called ( 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef in this session) and the data pointed to by the first argument ( 0xbaadf00dbaadf00d ).\\n\\nIf exploitation sounds trivial, note that there are some constraints on what pointers this vulnerability allows an attacker to call. Of course, in the presence of SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention), the attacker cannot just supply a user-mode shellcode pointer. What’s more, the callback invocation is an indirect call that may be safeguarded by kCFG (Kernel Control Flow Guard), requiring that the supplied kernel pointers represent valid kCFG call targets. In practice, this does not prevent exploitation, as the attacker can just find some kCFG-compliant gadget function that would turn this into another primitive, such as a (limited) read/write. There are also a few other constraints on the IOCTL input buffer that must be solved in order to reach the vulnerable callback invocation. However, these too are relatively straightforward to satisfy, as the attacker only needs to fake some kernel objects and supply the right values so that the IOCTL handler passes all the necessary checks while at the same time not crashing the kernel.\\n\\nThe vulnerable IOCTL is exposed through a device object named \\\\Device\\\\AppId . Breaking down the 0x22A018 control code and extracting the RequiredAccess field reveals that a handle with write access is required to call it. Inspecting the device’s ACL (Access Control List; see the screenshot below), there are entries for local service , administrators , and appidsvc . While the entry for administrators does not grant write access, the entry for local service does. Therefore, to describe CVE-2024-21338 more accurately, we should label it local service-to-kernel rather than admin-to-kernel. It’s also noteworthy that appid.sys might create two additional device objects, namely \\\\Device\\\\AppidEDPPlugin and \\\\Device\\\\SrpDevice . Although these come with more permissive ACLs, the vulnerable IOCTL handler is unreachable through them, rendering them irrelevant for exploitation purposes.\\n\\nAccess control entries of \\\\Device\\\\AppId , revealing that while local service is allowed write access, administrators are not.\\n\\nAs the local service account has reduced privileges compared to administrators, this also gives the vulnerability a somewhat higher impact than standard admin-to-kernel. This might be the reason Microsoft characterized the CVE as Privileges Required: Low , taking into account that local service processes do not always necessarily have to run at higher integrity levels. However, for the purposes of this blog, we still chose to refer to CVE-2024-21338 mainly as an admin-to-kernel vulnerability because we find it better reflects how it was used in the wild – Lazarus was already running with elevated privileges and then impersonated the local service account just prior to calling the IOCTL.\\n\\nThe vulnerability was introduced in Win10 1703 (RS2/15063) when the 0x22A018 IOCTL handler was first implemented. Older builds are not affected as they lack support for the vulnerable IOCTL. Interestingly, the Lazarus exploit bails out if it encounters a build older than Win10 1809 (RS5/17763), completely disregarding three perfectly vulnerable Windows versions. As for the later versions, the vulnerability extended all the way up to the most recent builds, including Win11 23H2. There have been some slight changes to the IOCTL, including an extra argument expected in the input buffer, but nothing that would prevent exploitation.\\n\\nWe developed a custom PoC (Proof of Concept) exploit and submitted it in August 2023 as part of a vulnerability report to Microsoft, leading to an advisory for CVE-2024-21338 in the February Patch Tuesday update. The update addressed the vulnerability by adding an ExGetPreviousMode check to the IOCTL handler (see the patch below). This aims to prevent user-mode initiated IOCTLs from triggering the arbitrary callbacks.\\n\\nThe patched IOCTL handler. If feature 2959575357 is enabled, attempts to call the IOCTL with PreviousMode==UserMode should immediately result in STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST , failing to even reach AipSmartHashImageFile .\\n\\nThough the vulnerability may only barely meet Microsoft’s security servicing criteria, we believe patching was the right choice and would like to thank Microsoft for eventually addressing this issue. Patching will undoubtedly disrupt Lazarus’ offensive operations, forcing them to either find a new admin-to-kernel zero-day or revert to using BYOVD techniques. While discovering an admin-to-kernel zero-day may not be as challenging as discovering a zero-day in a more attractive attack surface (such as standard user-to-kernel, or even sandbox-to-kernel), we believe that finding one would still require Lazarus to invest significant resources, potentially diverting their focus from attacking some other unfortunate targets.\\n\\nExploitation\\n\\nThe Lazarus exploit begins with an initialization stage, which performs a one-time setup for both the exploit and the rootkit (both have been compiled into the same module). This initialization starts by dynamically resolving all necessary Windows API functions, followed by a low-effort anti-debug check on PEB.BeingDebugged . Then, the exploit inspects the build number to see if it’s running on a supported Windows version. If so, it loads hardcoded constants tailored to the current build. Interestingly, the choice of constants sometimes comes down to the update build revision (UBR), showcasing a high degree of dedication towards ensuring that the code runs cleanly across a wide range of target machines.\\n\\nA decompiled code snippet, loading version-specific hardcoded constants. This particular example contains offsets and syscall numbers for Win10 1809.\\n\\nThe initialization process then continues with leaking the base addresses of three kernel modules: ntoskrnl , netio , and fltmgr . This is achieved by calling NtQuerySystemInformation using the SystemModuleInformation class. The KTHREAD address of the currently executing thread is also leaked in a similar fashion, by duplicating the current thread pseudohandle and then finding the corresponding kernel object address using the SystemExtendedHandleInformation system information class. Finally, the exploit manually loads the ntoskrnl image into the user address space, only to scan for relative virtual addresses (RVAs) of some functions of interest.\\n\\nSince the appid.sys driver does not have to be already loaded on the target machine, the exploit may first have to load it itself. It chooses to accomplish this in an indirect way, by writing an event to one specific AppLocker-related ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) provider. Once appid.sys is loaded, the exploit impersonates the local service account using a direct syscall to NtSetInformationThread with the ThreadImpersonationToken thread information class. By impersonating local service , it can now obtain a read/write handle to \\\\Device\\\\AppId . With this handle, the exploit finally prepares the IOCTL input buffer and triggers the vulnerability using the NtDeviceIoControlFile syscall.\\n\\nDirect syscalls are heavily used throughout the exploit.\\n\\nThe exploit crafts the IOCTL input buffer in such a way that the vulnerable callback is essentially a gadget that performs a 64-bit copy from the IOCTL input buffer to an arbitrary target address. This address was chosen to corrupt the PreviousMode of the current thread. By ensuring the corresponding source byte in the IOCTL input buffer is zero, the copy will clear the PreviousMode field, effectively resulting in its value being interpreted as KernelMode . Targeting PreviousMode like this is a widely popular exploitation technique, as corrupting this one byte in the KTHREAD structure bypasses kernel-mode checks inside syscalls such as NtReadVirtualMemory or NtWriteVirtualMemory , allowing a user-mode attacker to read and write arbitrary kernel memory. Note that while this technique was mitigated on some Windows Insider Builds, this mitigation has yet to reach general availability at the time of writing.\\n\\nInterestingly, the exploit may attempt to trigger the vulnerable IOCTL twice. This is due to an extra argument that was added in Win11 22H2. As a result, the IOCTL handler on newer builds expects the input buffer to be 0x20 bytes in size while, previously, the expected size was only 0x18 . Rather than selecting the proper input buffer size for the current build, the exploit just tries calling the IOCTL twice: first with an input buffer size 0x18 then – if not successful – with 0x20 . This is a valid approach since the IOCTL handler’s first action is to check the input buffer size, and if it doesn’t match the expected size, it would just immediately return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER .\\n\\nTo check if it was successful, the exploit employs the NtWriteVirtualMemory syscall, attempting to read the current thread’s PreviousMode (Lazarus avoids using NtReadVirtualMemory , more on this later). If the exploit succeeded, the syscall should return STATUS_SUCCESS , and the leaked PreviousMode byte should equal 0 (meaning KernelMode ). Otherwise, the syscall should return an error status code, as it should be impossible to read kernel memory without a corrupted PreviousMode .\\n\\nIn our exploit analysis, we deliberately chose to omit some key details, such as the choice of the callback gadget function. This decision was made to strike the right balance between helping defenders with detection but not making exploitation too widely accessible. For those requiring more information for defensive purposes, we may be able to share additional details on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nThe FudModule Rootkit\\n\\nThe entire goal of the admin-to-kernel exploit was to corrupt the current thread’s PreviousMode . This allows for a powerful kernel read/write primitive, where the affected user-mode thread can read and write arbitrary kernel memory using the Nt(Read|Write)VirtualMemory syscalls. Armed with this primitive, the FudModule rootkit employs direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) techniques to disrupt various kernel security mechanisms. It’s worth reiterating that FudModule is a data-only rootkit, meaning it executes entirely from user space and all the kernel tampering is performed through the read/write primitive.\\n\\nThe first variants of the FudModule rootkit were independently discovered by AhnLab and ESET research teams, with both publishing detailed analyses in September 2022. The rootkit was named after the FudModule.dll string used as the name in its export table. While this artifact is not present anymore, there is no doubt that what we found is an updated version of the same rootkit. AhnLab’s report documented a sample from early 2022, which incorporated seven data-only rootkit techniques and was enabled through a BYOVD exploit for ene.sys. ESET’s report examined a slightly earlier variant from late 2021, also featuring seven rootkit techniques but exploiting a different BYOVD vulnerability in dbutil_2_3.sys. In contrast, our discovery concerns a sample featuring nine rootkit techniques and exploiting a previously unknown admin-to-kernel vulnerability. Out of these nine techniques, four are new, three are improved, and two remain unchanged from the previous variants. This leaves two of the original seven techniques, which have been deprecated and are no longer present in the latest variant.\\n\\nEach rootkit technique is assigned a bit, ranging from 0x1 to 0x200 (the 0x20 bit is left unused in the current variant). FudModule executes the techniques sequentially, in an ascending order of the assigned bits. The bits are used to report on the success of the individual techniques. During execution, FudModule will construct an integer value (named bitfield_techniques in the decompilation below), where only the bits corresponding to successfully executed techniques will be set. This integer is ultimately written to a file named tem1245.tmp , reporting on the rootkit’s success. Interestingly, we did not find this filename referenced in any other Lazarus sample, suggesting the dropped file is only inspected through hands-on-keyboard activity, presumably through a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) command. This supports our beliefs that FudModule is only loosely integrated into the rest of Lazarus’ malware ecosystem and that Lazarus is very careful about using the rootkit, only deploying it on demand under the right circumstances.\\n\\nThe rootkit’s “main” function, executing the individual rootkit techniques. Note the missing 0x20 technique.\\n\\nBased on the large number of updates, it seems that FudModule remains under active development. The latest variant appears more robust, avoiding some potentially problematic practices from the earlier variants. Since some techniques target undocumented kernel internals in a way that we have not previously encountered, we believe that Lazarus must be conducting their own kernel research. Further, though the rootkit is certainly technically sophisticated, we still identified a few bugs here and there. These may either limit the rootkit’s intended functionality or even cause kernel bug checks under the right conditions. While we find some of these bugs very interesting and would love to share the details, we do not enjoy the idea of providing free bug reports to threat actors, so we will hold onto them for now and potentially share some information later if the bugs get fixed.\\n\\nInterestingly, FudModule utilizes the NtWriteVirtualMemory syscall for both reading and writing kernel memory, eliminating the need to call NtReadVirtualMemory . This leverages the property that, when limited to a single virtual address space, NtReadVirtualMemory and NtWriteVirtualMemory are basically inverse operations with respect to the values of the source Buffer and the destination BaseAddress arguments. In other words, writing to kernel memory can be thought of as writing from a user-mode Buffer to a kernel-mode BaseAddress , while reading from kernel memory could be conversely achieved by swapping arguments, that is writing from a kernel-mode Buffer to a user-mode BaseAddress . Lazarus’ implementation takes advantage of this, which seems to be an intentional design decision since most developers would likely prefer the more straightforward way of using NtReadVirtualMemory for reading kernel memory and NtWriteVirtualMemory for writing kernel memory. We can only guess why Lazarus chose this approach, but this might be yet another stealth-enhancing feature. With their implementation, they only must use one suspicious syscall instead of two, potentially reducing the number detection opportunities.\\n\\nDebug Prints\\n\\nBefore we delve into the actual rootkit techniques, there is one last thing worth discussing. To our initial surprise, Lazarus left a handful of plaintext debug prints in the compiled code. Such prints are typically one of the best things that can happen to a malware researcher, because they tend to accelerate the reverse engineering process significantly. In this instance, however, some of the prints had the opposite effect, sometimes even making us question if we understood the code correctly.\\n\\nAs an example, let us mention the string get rop function addresses failed . Assuming rop stands for return-oriented programming, this string would make perfect sense in the context of exploitation, if not for the fact that not a single return address was corrupted in the exploit.\\n\\nPlaintext debug strings found in the rootkit. The term vaccine is used to refer to security software.\\n\\nWhile written in English, the debug strings suggest their authors are not native speakers, occasionally even pointing to their supposed Korean origin. This is best seen on the frequent usage of the term vaccine throughout the rootkit. This had us scratching our heads at first, because it was unclear how vaccines would relate to the rootkit functionality. However, it soon became apparent that the term was used to refer to security software. This might originate from a common Korean translation of antivirus (바이러스 백신), a compound word with the literal meaning virus vaccine. Note that even North Korea’s “own” antivirus was called SiliVaccine, and to the best of our knowledge, the term vaccine would not be used like this in other languages such as Japanese. Additionally, this is not the first time Korean-speaking threat actors have used this term. For instance, AhnLab’s recent report on Kimsuky mentions the following telltale command:\\n\\n\\n\\ncmd.exe /U /c wmic /namespace:\\\\\\\\root\\\\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct get displayname > vaccine.txt\\n\\nAnother puzzle is the abbreviation pvmode , which we believe refers to PreviousMode . A Google search for pvmode yields exactly zero relevant results, and we suspect most English speakers would choose different abbreviations, such as prvmode or prevmode . However, after consulting this with language experts, we learned that using the abbreviation pvmode would be unusual for Korean speakers too.\\n\\nFinally, there is also the debug message disableV3Protection passed . Judging from the context, the rather generic term V3 here refers to AhnLab V3 Endpoint Security. Considering the geopolitical situation, North Korean hacker groups are likely well-acquainted with South Korean AhnLab, so it would make perfect sense that they internally refer to them using such a non-specific shorthand.\\n\\n0x01 – Registry Callbacks\\n\\nThe first rootkit technique is designed to address registry callbacks. This is a documented Windows mechanism which allows security solutions to monitor registry operations. A security solution’s kernel-mode component can call the CmRegisterCallbackEx routine to register a callback, which gets notified whenever a registry operation is performed on the system. What’s more, since the callback is invoked synchronously, before (or after) the actual operation is performed, the callback can even block or modify forbidden/malicious operations. FudModule’s goal here is to remove existing registry callbacks and thus disrupt security solutions that rely on this mechanism.\\n\\nThe callback removal itself is performed by directly modifying some internal data structures managed by the kernel. This was also the case in the previous version, as documented by ESET and AhnLab. There, the rootkit found the address of nt!CallbackListHead (which contains a doubly linked, circular list of all existing registry callbacks) and simply emptied it by pointing it to itself.\\n\\nIn the current version of FudModule, this technique was improved to leave some selected callbacks behind, perhaps making the rootkit stealthier. This updated version starts the same as the previous one: by finding the address of nt!CallbackListHead . This is done by resolving CmUnRegisterCallback (this resolution is performed by name, through iterating over the export table of ntoskrnl in memory), scanning its function body for the lea rcx,[nt!CallbackListHead] instruction, and then calculating the final address from the offset extracted from the instruction’s opcodes.\\n\\nWith the nt!CallbackListHead address, FudModule can iterate over the registry callback linked list. It inspects each entry and determines if the callback routine is implemented in ntoskrnl.exe , applockerfltr.sys , or bfs.sys . If it is, the callback is left untouched. Otherwise, the rootkit replaces the callback routine pointer with a pointer to ObIsKernelHandle and then proceeds to unlink the callback entry.\\n\\n0x02 – Object Callbacks\\n\\nObject callbacks allow drivers to execute custom code in response to thread, process, and desktop handle operations. They are often used in self-defense, as they represent a convenient way to protect critical processes from being tampered with. Since the protection is enforced at the kernel level, this should protect even against elevated attackers, as long as they stay in user mode. Alternatively, object callbacks are also useful for monitoring and detecting suspicious activity.\\n\\nWhatever the use case, object callbacks can be set up using the ObRegisterCallbacks routine. FudModule naturally attempts to do the exact opposite: that is to remove all registered object callbacks. This could let it bypass self-defense mechanisms and evade object callback-based detection/telemetry.\\n\\nThe implementation of this rootkit technique has stayed the same since the previous version, so there is no need to go into too much detail. First, the rootkit scans the body of the ObGetObjectType routine to obtain the address of nt!ObTypeIndexTable . This contains an array of pointers to _OBJECT_TYPE structures, each of which represents a distinct object type, such as Process , Token , or SymbolicLink . FudModule iterates over this array (skipping the first two special-meaning elements) and inspects each _OBJECT_TYPE.CallbackList , which contains a doubly linked list of object callbacks registered for the particular object type. The rootkit then empties the CallbackList by making each node’s forward and backward pointer point to itself.\\n\\n0x04 – Process, Thread, and Image Kernel Callbacks\\n\\nThis next rootkit technique is designed to disable three more types of kernel callbacks: process, thread, and image callbacks. As their names suggest, these are used to execute custom kernel code whenever a new process is created, a new thread spawned, or a new image loaded (e.g. a DLL loaded into a process). These callbacks are extremely useful for detecting malicious activity. For instance, process callbacks allow AVs and EDRs to perform various checks on each new process that is to be created. Registering these callbacks is very straightforward. All that is needed is to pass the new callback routine as an argument to PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine , PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine , or PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine . These routines also come in their updated Ex variants, or even Ex2 in the case of PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx2 .\\n\\nProcess, thread, and image callbacks are managed by the kernel in an almost identical way, which allows FudModule to use essentially the same code to disable all three of them. We find that this code has not changed much since the previous version, with the main difference being new additions to the list of drivers whose callbacks are left untouched.\\n\\nFudModule first finds the addresses of nt!PspNotifyEnableMask , nt!PspLoadImageNotifyRoutine , nt!PspCreateThreadNotifyRoutine , and nt!PspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine . These are once again obtained by scanning the code of exported routines, with the exact scanning method subject to some variation based on the Windows build number. Before any modification is performed, the rootkit clears nt!PspNotifyEnableMask and sleeps for a brief amount of time. This mask contains a bit field of currently enabled callback types, so clearing it disables all callbacks. While some EDR bypasses would stop here, FudModule’s goal is not to disable all callbacks indiscriminately, so the modification of nt!PspNotifyEnableMask is only temporary, and FudModule eventually restores it back to its original value. We believe the idea behind this temporary modification is to decrease the chance of a race condition that could potentially result in a bug check.\\n\\nAll three of the above nt!Psp(LoadImage|CreateThread|CreateProcess)NotifyRoutine globals are organized as an array of _EX_FAST_REF pointers to _EX_CALLBACK_ROUTINE_BLOCK structures (at least that’s the name used in ReactOS, Microsoft does not share a symbol name here). FudModule iterates over all these structures and checks if _EX_CALLBACK_ROUTINE_BLOCK.Function (the actual callback routine pointer) is implemented in one of the below-whitelisted modules. If it is, the pointer will get appended to a new array that will be used to replace the original one. This effectively removes all callbacks except for those implemented in one of the below-listed modules.\\n\\nntoskrnl.exe ahcache.sys mmcss.sys cng.sys ksecdd.sys tcpip.sys iorate.sys ci.dll dxgkrnl.sys peauth.sys wtd.sys Kernel modules that are allowed during the removal of process, thread, and image callbacks.\\n\\n0x08 – Minifilter Drivers\\n\\nFile system minifilters provide a mechanism for drivers to intercept file system operations. They are used in a wide range of scenarios, including encryption, compression, replication, monitoring, antivirus scanning, or file system virtualization. For instance, an encryption minifilter would encrypt the data before it is written to the storage device and, conversely, decrypt the data after it is read. FudModule is trying to get rid of all the monitoring and antivirus minifilters while leaving the rest untouched (after all, some minifilters are crucial to keep the system running). The choice about which minifilters to keep and which to remove is based mainly on the minifilter’s altitude, an integer value that is used to decide the processing order in case there are multiple minifilters attached to the same operation. Microsoft defines altitude ranges that should be followed by well-behaved minifilters. Unfortunately, these ranges also represent a very convenient way for FudModule to distinguish anti-malware minifilters from the rest.\\n\\nIn its previous version, FudModule disabled minifilters by directly patching their filter functions’ prologues. This would be considered very unusual today, with HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) becoming more prevalent, even turned on by default on Windows 11. Since HVCI is a security feature designed to prevent the execution of arbitrary code in the kernel, it would stand in the way of FudModule trying to patch the filter function. This forced Lazarus to completely reimplement this rootkit technique, so the current version of FudModule disables file system minifilters in a brand-new data-only attack.\\n\\nThis attack starts by resolving FltEnumerateFilters and using it to find FltGlobals.FrameList.rList . This is a linked list of FLTMGR!_FLTP_FRAME structures, each representing a single filter manager frame. From here, FudModule follows another linked list at _FLTP_FRAME.AttachedVolumes.rList . This linked list consists of FLTMGR!_FLT_VOLUME structures, describing minifilters attached to a particular file system volume. Interestingly, the rootkit performs a sanity check to make sure that the pool tag associated with the _FLT_VOLUME allocation is equal to FMvo . With the sanity check satisfied, FudModule iterates over _FLT_VOLUME.Callbacks.OperationsLists , which is an array of linked lists of FLTMGR!_CALLBACK_NODE structures, indexed by IRP major function codes. For instance, OperationsLists[IRP_MJ_READ] is a linked list describing all filters attached to the read operation on a particular volume.\\n\\nFudModule making sure the pool tag of a _FLT_VOLUME chunk is equal to FMvo .\\n\\nFor each _CALLBACK_NODE , FudModule obtains the corresponding FLTMGR!_FLT_INSTANCE and FLTMGR!_FLT_FILTER structures and uses them to decide whether to unlink the callback node. The first check is based on the name of the driver behind the filter. If it is hmpalert.sys (associated with the HitmanPro anti-malware solution), the callback will get immediately unlinked. Conversely, the callback is preserved if the driver’s name matches an entry in the following list:\\n\\nbindflt.sys storqosflt.sys wcifs.sys cldflt.sys filecrypt.sys luafv.sys npsvctrig.sys wof.sys fileinfo.sys applockerfltr.sys bfs.sys Kernel modules that are allowlisted to preserve their file system minifilters.\\n\\nIf there was no driver name match, FudModule uses _FLT_FILTER.DefaultAltitude to make its ultimate decision. Callbacks are unlinked if the default altitude belongs either to the range [320000, 329999] (defined as FSFilter Anti-Virus by Microsoft) or the range [360000, 389999] ( FSFilter Activity Monitor ). Besides unlinking the callback nodes, FudModule also wipes the whole _FLT_INSTANCE.CallbackNodes array in the corresponding _FLT_INSTANCE structures.\\n\\n0x10 – Windows Filtering Platform\\n\\nWindows Filtering Platform (WFP) is a documented set of APIs designed for host-based network traffic filtering. The WFP API offers capabilities for deep packet inspection as well as for modification or dropping of packets at various layers of the network stack. This is very useful functionality, so it serves as a foundation for a lot of Windows network security software, including intrusion detection/prevention systems, firewalls, and network monitoring tools. The WFP API is accessible both in user and kernel space, with the kernel part offering more powerful functionality. Specifically, the kernel API allows for installing so-called callout drivers, which can essentially hook into the network stack and perform arbitrary actions on the processed network traffic. FudModule is trying to interfere with the installed callout routines in an attempt to disrupt the security they provide.\\n\\nThis rootkit technique is executed only when Kaspersky drivers ( klam.sys , klif.sys , klwfp.sys , klwtp.sys , klboot.sys ) are present on the targeted system and at the same time Symantec/Broadcom drivers ( symevnt.sys , bhdrvx64.sys , srtsp64.sys ) are absent. This check appears to be a new addition in the current version of FudModule. In other aspects, our analysis revealed that the core idea of this technique matches the findings described by ESET researchers during their analysis of the previous version.\\n\\nInitially, FudModule resolves netio!WfpProcessFlowDelete to locate the address of netio!gWfpGlobal . As the name suggests, this is designed to store WFP-related global variables. Although its exact layout is undocumented, it is not hard to find the build-specific offset where a pointer to an array of WFP callout structures is stored (with the length of this array stored at an offset immediately preceding the pointer). FudModule follows this pointer and iterates over the array, skipping all callouts implemented in ndu.sys , tcpip.sys , mpsdrv.sys , or wtd.sys . For the remaining callouts, FudModule accesses the callout structure’s flags and sets the flag stored in the least significant bit. While the callout structure itself is undocumented, this particular 0x01 flag is documented in another structure, where it is called FWP_CALLOUT_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_ON_FLOW . The documentation reads “if this flag is specified, the filter engine calls the callout driver’s classifyFn2 callout function only if there is a context associated with the data flow”. In other words, setting this flag will conditionally disable the callout in cases where no flow context is available (see the implementation of netio!IsActiveCallout below).\\n\\nThe meaning of the FWP_CALLOUT_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_ON_FLOW flag can be nicely seen in netio!IsActiveCallout . If this flag is set and no flow context can be obtained, IsActiveCallout will return false (see the highlighted part of the condition).\\n\\nWhile this rootkit technique has the potential to interfere with some WFP callouts, it will not be powerful enough to disrupt all of them. Many WFP callouts registered by security vendors already have the FWP_CALLOUT_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_ON_FLOW flag set by design, so they will not be affected by this technique at all. Given the initial driver check, it seems like this technique might be targeted directly at Kaspersky. While Kaspersky does install dozens of WFP callouts, about half of those are designed for processing flows and already have the FWP_CALLOUT_FLAG_CONDITIONAL_ON_FLOW flag set. Since we refrained from reverse engineering our competitor’s products, the actual impact of this rootkit technique remains unclear.\\n\\n0x20 – Missing\\n\\nSo far, the rootkit techniques we analyzed were similar to those detailed by ESET in their paper on the earlier rootkit variant. But starting from now, we are getting into a whole new territory. The 0x20 technique, which used to deal with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), has been deprecated, leaving the 0x20 bit unused. Instead, there are two new replacement techniques that target ETW, indexed with the bits 0x40 and 0x80 . The indexing used to end at 0x40 , which was a technique to obstruct forensic analysis by disabling prefetch file creation. However, now the bits go all the way up to 0x200 , with two additional new techniques that we will delve into later in this blog.\\n\\n0x40 – Event Tracing for Windows: System Loggers\\n\\nEvent Tracing for Windows (ETW) serves as a high-performance mechanism dedicated to tracing and logging events. In a nutshell, its main purpose is to connect providers (who generate some log events) with consumers (who process the generated events). Consumers can define which events they would like to consume, for instance, by selecting some specific providers of interest. There are providers built into the operating system, like Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process which generates process-related events, such as process creation or termination. However, third-party applications can also define their custom providers.\\n\\nWhile many built-in providers are not security-related, some generate events useful for detection purposes. For instance, the Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence provider makes it possible to watch for suspicious events, such as writing another process’ memory. Furthermore, various security products take advantage of ETW by defining their custom providers and consumers. FudModule tampers with ETW internals in an attempt to intercept suspicious events and thus evade detection.\\n\\nThe main idea behind this rootkit technique is to disable system loggers by zeroing out EtwpActiveSystemLoggers . The specific implementation of how this address is found varies based on the target Windows version. On newer builds, the nt!EtwSendTraceBuffer routine is resolved first and used to find nt!EtwpHostSiloState . This points to an _ETW_SILODRIVERSTATE structure, and using a hardcoded build-specific offset, the rootkit can access _ETW_SILODRIVERSTATE.SystemLoggerSettings.EtwpActiveSystemLoggers . On older builds, the rootkit first scans the entire ntoskrnl .text section, searching for opcode bytes specific to the EtwTraceKernelEvent prologue. The rootkit then extracts the target address from the mov ebx, cs:EtwpActiveSystemLoggers instruction that immediately follows.\\n\\nTo understand the technique’s impact, we can take a look at how EtwpActiveSystemLoggers is used in the kernel. Accessed on a bit-by-bit basis, its least significant eight bits might be set in the EtwpStartLogger routine. This indicates that the value itself is a bit field, with each bit signifying whether a particular system logger is active. Looking at the other references to EtwpActiveSystemLoggers , a clear pattern emerges. After its value is read, there tends to be a loop guarded by a bsf instruction (bit scan forward). Inside the loop tends to be a call to an ETW-related routine that might generate a log event. The purpose of this loop is to iterate over the set bits of EtwpActiveSystemLoggers . When the rootkit clears all the bits, the body of the loop will never get executed, meaning the event will not get logged.\\n\\nExample decompilation of EtwpTraceKernelEventWithFilter . After the rootkit zeroes out EtwpActiveSystemLoggers , EtwpLogKernelEvent will never get called from inside the loop since the condition guarding the loop will always evaluate to zero.\\n\\n0x80 – Event Tracing for Windows: Provider GUIDs\\n\\nComplementing the previous technique, the 0x80 technique is also designed to blind ETW, however using a different approach. While the 0x40 technique was quite generic – aiming to disable all system loggers – this technique operates in a more surgical fashion. It contains a hardcoded list of 95 GUIDs, each representing an identifier for some specific ETW provider. The rootkit iterates over all these GUIDs and attempts to disable the respective providers. While this approach requires the attackers to invest some effort into assembling the list of GUIDs, it also offers them a finer degree of control over which ETW providers they will eventually disrupt. This allows them to selectively target providers that pose a higher detection risk and ignore the rest to minimize the rootkit’s impact on the target system.\\n\\nThis technique starts by obtaining the address of EtwpHostSiloState (or EtwSiloState on older builds). If EtwpHostSiloState was already resolved during the previous technique, the rootkit just reuses the address. If not, the rootkit follows the reference chain PsGetCurrentServerSiloName -> PsGetCurrentServerSiloGlobals -> PspHostSiloGlobals -> EtwSiloState . In both scenarios, the result is that the rootkit just obtained a pointer to an _ETW_SILODRIVERSTATE structure, which contains a member named EtwpGuidHashTable . As the name suggests, this is a hash table holding ETW GUIDs ( _ETW_GUID_ENTRY ).\\n\\nFudModule then iterates over its hardcoded list of GUIDs and attempts to locate each of them in the hash table. Although the hash table internals are officially undocumented, Yarden Shafir provided a nice description in her blog on exploiting an ETW vulnerability. In a nutshell, the hash is computed by just splitting the 128-bit GUID into four 32-bit parts and XORing them together. By ANDing the hash with 0x3F , an index of the relevant hash bucket ( _ETW_HASH_BUCKET ) can be obtained. The bucket contains three linked lists of _ETW_GUID_ENTRY structures, each designated for a different type of GUIDs. FudModule always opts for the first one ( EtwTraceGuidType ) and traverses it, looking for the relevant _ETW_GUID_ENTRY structure.\\n\\nWith a pointer to _ETW_GUID_ENTRY corresponding to a GUID of interest, FudModule proceeds to clear _ETW_GUID_ENTRY.ProviderEnableInfo.IsEnabled . The purpose of this modification seems self-explanatory: FudModule is trying to disable the ETW provider. To better understand how this works, let’s examine nt!EtwEventEnabled (see the decompiled code below). This is a routine that often serves as an if condition before nt!EtwWrite (or nt!EtwWriteEx ) gets called.\\n\\nLooking at the decompilation, there are two return 1 statements. Setting ProviderEnableInfo.IsEnabled to zero ensures that the first one is never reached. However, the second return statement could still potentially execute. To make sure this doesn’t happen, the rootkit also iterates over all _ETW_REG_ENTRY structures from the _ETW_GUID_ENTRY.RegListHead linked list. For each of them, it makes a single doubleword write to zero out four masks, namely EnableMask , GroupEnableMask , HostEnableMask , and HostGroupEnableMask (or only EnableMask and GroupEnableMask on older builds, where the latter two masks were not yet introduced).\\n\\nDecompilation of nt!EtwEventEnabled . After the rootkit has finished its job, this routine will always return false for events related to the targeted GUIDs. This is because the rootkit cleared both _ETW_GUID_ENTRY.ProviderEnableInfo.IsEnabled and _ETW_REG_ENTRY.GroupEnableMask , forcing the highlighted conditions to fail.\\n\\nClearing these masks also has an additional effect beyond making EtwEventEnabled always return false . These four are all also checked in EtwWriteEx and this modification effectively neutralizes this routine, as when no mask is set for a particular event registration object, execution will never proceed to a lower-level routine ( nt!EtwpEventWriteFull ) where the bulk of the actual event writing logic is implemented.\\n\\n0x100 – Image Verification Callbacks\\n\\nImage verification callbacks are yet another callback mechanism disrupted by FudModule. Designed similarly to process/thread/image callbacks, image verification callbacks are supposed to get invoked whenever a new driver image is loaded into kernel memory. This represents useful functionality for anti-malware software, which can leverage them to blocklist known malicious or vulnerable drivers (though there might be some problems with this blocking approach as the callbacks get invoked asynchronously). Furthermore, image verification callbacks also offer a valuable source of telemetry, providing visibility into suspicious driver load events. The callbacks can be registered using the SeRegisterImageVerificationCallback routine, which is publicly undocumented. As a result of this undocumented nature, the usage here is limited mainly to deep-rooted anti-malware software. For instance, Windows Defender registers a callback named WdFilter!MpImageVerificationCallback .\\n\\nAs the kernel internally manages image verification callbacks in a similar fashion to some of the other callbacks we already explored, the rootkit’s removal implementation will undoubtedly seem familiar. First, the rootkit resolves the nt!SeRegisterImageVerificationCallback routine and scans its body to locate nt!ExCbSeImageVerificationDriverInfo . Dereferencing this, it obtains a pointer to a _CALLBACK_OBJECT structure, which holds the callbacks in the _CALLBACK_OBJECT.RegisteredCallbacks linked list. This list consists of _CALLBACK_REGISTRATION structures, where the actual callback function pointer can be found in _CALLBACK_REGISTRATION.CallbackFunction . FudModule clears the entire list by making the RegisteredCallbacks head LIST_ENTRY point directly to itself. Additionally, it also walks the original linked list and similarly short-circuits each individual _CALLBACK_REGISTRATION entry in the list.\\n\\nThis rootkit technique is newly implemented in the current version of FudModule, and we can only speculate on the motivation here. It seems to be designed to help avoid detection when loading either a vulnerable or a malicious driver. However, it might be hard to understand why Lazarus should want to load an additional driver if they already have control over the kernel. It would make little sense for them to load a vulnerable driver, as they already established their kernel read/write primitive by exploiting a zero-day in a preinstalled Windows driver. Further, even if they were exploiting a vulnerable driver in the first place (as was the case in the previous version of FudModule), it would be simply too late to unlink the callback now. By the time this rootkit technique executes, the image verification callback for the vulnerable driver would have already been invoked. Therefore, we believe the most likely explanation is that the threat actors are preparing the grounds for loading some malicious driver later. Perhaps the idea is that they just want to be covered in case they decide to deploy some additional kernel-mode payload in the future.\\n\\n0x200 – Direct Attacks on Security Software\\n\\nThe rootkit techniques we explored up to this point were all somewhat generic. Each targeted some security-related system component and, through it, indirectly interfered with all security software that relied on the component. In contrast, this final technique goes straight to the point and aims to directly disable specific security software. In particular, the targeted security solutions are AhnLab V3 Endpoint Security, Windows Defender, CrowdStrike Falcon, and HitmanPro.\\n\\nThe attack starts with the rootkit obtaining the address of its own _EPROCESS structure. This is done using NtDuplicateHandle to duplicate the current process pseudohandle and then calling NtQuerySystemInformation to get SystemExtendedHandleInformation . With the extended handle information, the rootkit looks for an entry corresponding to the duplicated handle and obtains the _EPROCESS pointer from there. Using NtQuerySystemInformation to leak kernel pointers is a well-known technique that Microsoft aims to restrict by gradually building up mitigations. However, attackers capable of enabling SeDebugPrivilege at high integrity levels are out of scope of these mitigations, so FudModule can keep using this technique, even on the upcoming 24H2 builds. With the _EPROCESS pointer, FudModule disables mitigations by zeroing out _EPROCESS.MitigationFlags . Then, it also clears the EnableHandleExceptions flag from _EPROCESS.ObjectTable.Flags . We believe this is meant to increase stability in case something goes wrong later during the handle table entry manipulation technique that we will describe shortly.\\n\\nRegarding the specific technique used to attack the security solutions, AhnLab is handled differently than the other three targets. FudModule first checks if AhnLab is even running, by traversing the ActiveProcessLinks linked list and looking for a process named asdsvc.exe (AhnLab Smart Defense Service) with _EPROCESS.Token.AuthenticationId set to SYSTEM_LUID . If such a process is found, FudModule clears its _EPROCESS.Protection byte, effectively toggling off PPL protection for the process. While this asdsvc.exe process is under usual circumstances meant to be protected at the standard PsProtectedSignerAntimalware level, this modification makes it just a regular non-protected process. This opens it up to further attacks from user mode, where now even other privileged, yet non-protected processes could be able to tamper with it. However, we suspect the main idea behind this technique might be to disrupt the link between AhnLab’s user-mode and kernel-mode components. By removing the service’s PPL protection, the kernel-mode component might no longer recognize it as a legitimate AhnLab component. However, this is just a speculation as we didn’t test the real impact of this technique.\\n\\nHandle Table Entry Manipulation\\n\\nThe technique employed to attack Defender, CrowdStrike, and HitmanPro is much more intriguing: FudModule attempts to suspend them using a new handle table entry manipulation technique. To better understand this technique, let’s begin with a brief background on handle tables. When user-mode code interacts with kernel objects such as processes, files, or mutexes, it typically doesn’t work with the objects directly. Instead, it references them indirectly through handles. Internally, the kernel must be able to translate the handle to the corresponding object, and this is where the handle table comes in. This per-process table, available at _EPROCESS.ObjectTable.TableCode , serves as a mapping from handles to the underlying objects. Organized as an array, it is indexed by the integer value of the handle. Each element is of type _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY and contains two crucial pieces of information: a (compressed) pointer to the object’s header ( nt!_OBJECT_HEADER ) and access bits associated with the handle.\\n\\nDue to this handle design, kernel object access checks are typically split into two separate logical steps. The first step happens when a process attempts to acquire a handle (such as opening a file with CreateFile ). During this step, the current thread’s token is typically checked against the target object’s security descriptor to ensure that the thread is allowed to obtain a handle with the desired access mask. The second check takes place when a process performs an operation using an already acquired handle (such as writing to a file with WriteFile ). This typically only involves verifying that the handle is powerful enough (meaning it has the right access bits) for the requested operation.\\n\\nFudModule executes as a non-protected process, so it theoretically shouldn’t be able to obtain a powerful handle to a PPL-protected process such as the CrowdStrike Falcon Service. However, leveraging the kernel read/write primitive, FudModule has the ability to access the handle table directly. This allows it to craft a custom handle table entry with control over both the referenced object and the access bits. This way, it can conjure an arbitrary handle to any object, completely bypassing the check typically needed for handle acquisition. What’s more, if it sets the handle’s access bits appropriately, it will also satisfy the subsequent handle checks when performing its desired operations.\\n\\nTo prepare for the handle table entry manipulation technique, FudModule creates a dummy thread that just puts itself to sleep immediately. The thread itself is not important. What is important is that by calling CreateThread , the rootkit just obtained a thread handle with THREAD_ALL_ACCESS rights. This handle is the one that will have its handle table entry manipulated. Since it already has very powerful access bits, the rootkit will not even have to touch its _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY.GrantedAccessBits . All it needs to do is overwrite _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY.ObjectPointerBits to redirect the handle to an arbitrary object of its choice. This will make the handle reference that object and enable the rootkit to perform privileged operations on it. Note that ObjectPointerBits is not the whole pointer to the object: it only represents 44 bits of the 64-bit pointer. But since the _OBJECT_HEADER pointed to by ObjectPointerBits is guaranteed to be aligned (meaning the least significant four bits must be zero) and in kernel address space (meaning the most significant sixteen bits must be 0xFFFF ), the remaining 20 bits can be easily inferred.\\n\\nA dummy thread whose handle will be the subject of handle table entry manipulation.\\n\\nThe specific processes targeted by this technique are MsSense.exe , MsMpEng.exe , CSFalconService.exe , and hmpalert.exe . FudModule first finds their respective _EPROCESS structures, employing the same algorithm as it did to find the AhnLab service. Then, it performs a sanity check to ensure that the dummy thread handle is not too high by comparing it with _EPROCESS.ObjectTable.NextHandleNeedingPool (which holds information on the maximum possible handle value given the current handle table allocation size). With the sanity check satisfied, FudModule accesses the handle table itself ( EPROCESS.ObjectTable.TableCode ) and modifies the dummy thread’s _HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY so that it points to the _OBJECT_HEADER of the target _EPROCESS . Finally, the rootkit uses the redirected handle to call NtSuspendProcess , which will suspend the targeted process.\\n\\nIt might seem odd that the manipulated handle used to be a thread handle, but now it’s being used as a process handle. In practice, there is nothing wrong with this since the handle table itself holds no object type information. The object type is stored in _OBJECT_HEADER.TypeIndex so when the rootkit redirected the handle, it also effectively changed the handle object type. As for the access bits, the original THREAD_ALL_ACCESS gets reinterpreted in the new context as PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS since both constants share the same underlying value.\\n\\nThe manipulated dummy thread handle ( 0x168 ), now referencing a process object.\\n\\nThough suspending the target process might initially appear to be a completed job, FudModule doesn’t stop here. After taking five seconds of sleep, it also attempts to iterate over all the threads in the target process, suspending them one by one. When all threads are suspended, FudModule uses NtResumeProcess to resume the suspended process. At this point, while the process itself is technically resumed, its individual threads remain suspended, meaning the process is still effectively in a suspended state. We can only speculate why Lazarus implemented process suspension this way, but it seems like an attempt to make the technique stealthier. After all, a suspended process is much more conspicuous than just several threads with increased suspend counts.\\n\\nTo enumerate threads, FudModule calls NtQuerySystemInformation with the SystemExtendedHandleInformation class. Iterating over the returned handle information, FudModule searches for thread handles from the target process. The owner process is checked by comparing the PID of the target process with SYSTEM_HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY_INFO_EX.UniqueProcessId and the type is checked by comparing SYSTEM_HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY_INFO_EX.ObjectTypeIndex with the thread type index, which was previously obtained using NtQueryObject to get ObjectTypesInformation . For each enumerated thread (which might include some threads multiple times, as there might be more than one open handle to the same thread), FudModule manipulates the dummy thread handle so that it points to the enumerated thread and suspends it by calling SuspendThread on the manipulated handle. Finally, after all threads are suspended and the process resumed, FudModule restores the manipulated handle to its original state, once again referencing the dummy sleep thread.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Lazarus Group remains among the most prolific and long-standing advanced persistent threat actors. Though their signature tactics and techniques are well-recognized by now, they still occasionally manage to surprise us with an unexpected level of technical sophistication. The FudModule rootkit serves as the latest example, representing one of the most complex tools Lazarus holds in their arsenal. Recent updates examined in this blog show Lazarus’ commitment to keep actively developing this rootkit, focusing on improvements in both stealth and functionality.\\n\\nWith their admin-to-kernel zero-day now burned, Lazarus is confronted with a significant challenge. They can either discover a new zero-day exploit or revert to their old BYOVD techniques. Regardless of their choice, we will continue closely monitoring their activity, eager to see how they will cope with these new circumstances.\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\\n\\nA YARA rule for the latest FudModule variant is available at https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/FudModule#yara.'),\n",

Most ransomware strains perform file encryption; HomuWitch also adds file compression. This causes the encrypted files to be smaller than originals.\\n\\nHomuWitch file-encryption routine\\n\\nHomuWitch contains a vulnerability present during the encryption process that allows the victims to retrieve all their files without paying the ransom. New or previously unknown samples may make use of different encryption schema, so they may not be decryptable without further analysis.\\n\\nIt is also using command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure for its operation, mostly located in Europe. Before encryption, HomuWitch sends the following personal information to its CnC servers:\\n\\nComputer name, Country code, Keyboard layout, Device ID\\n\\nHomuWitch CnC communication\\n\\nAfter encryption, a ransom note is either retrieved from the CnC server or (in some samples) is stored in the sample resources. The ransom typically varies $25 to $70, demanding the payment to be made with Monero cryptocurrency. Here is an example of HomuWitch ransom note:\\n\\nHow to use the Avast HomuWitch ransomware decryption tool to decrypt files encrypted by the ransomware\\n\\nFollow these steps to decrypt your files:\\n\\nDownload the free decryptor here. Run the executable file. It starts as a wizard, leading you through the configuration of the decryption process. On the initial page, you can read the license information if you want, but you only need to click “Next”\\n\\nOn the following page, select the list of locations you want to be searched for and decrypted. By default, it contains a list of all local drives:\\n\\nOn the third page, you need to provide a file in its original form and one which was encrypted by the HomuWitch ransomware. Enter both names of the files. If you have an encryption password created by a previous run of the decryptor, you can select “I know the password for decrypting files” option:\\n\\nThe next page is where the password cracking process takes place. Click “Start” when you are ready to start the process. The password cracking process uses all known HomuWitch passwords to determine the correct one.\\n\\nOnce the password is found, you can proceed to decrypt all the encrypted files on your PC by clicking “Next”.\\n\\nOn the final page, you can opt-in to back up your encrypted files. These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This option is on by default, which we recommend. After clicking “Decrypt” the decryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes decrypting all of your files.\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\\n\\nSamples (SHA256)\\n\\n03e4f770157c11d86d462cc4e9ebeddee3130565221700841a7239e68409accf\\n\\n0e42c452b5795a974061712928d5005169126ad1201bd2b9490f377827528e5d\\n\\n16c3eea8ed3a44ee22dad8e8aec0c8c6b43c23741498f11337779e6621d1fe4e\\n\\n33dd6dfd51b79dad25357f07a8fb4da47cec010e0f8e6d164c546a18ad2a762c\\n\\n3546b2dd517a99249ef5fd8dfd2a8fd80cb89dfdc9e38602e1f3115634789316\\n\\n4ea00f1ffe2bbbf5476c0eb677ac75cf1a765fe5c8ce899f47eb8b344da878ed\\n\\n6252cda4786396ebd7e9baf8ff0454d6af038aed48a7e4ec33cd9249816db2f4\\n\\n9343a0714a0e159b1d49b591f0835398076af8c8e2da56cbb8c9b7a15c9707c8\\n\\nbd90468f50629728d717c53cd7806ba59d6ad9377163d0d3328d6db4db6a3826\\n\\ncd4c3db443dbfd768c59575ede3b1e26002277c109d39ea020d1bc307374e309\\n\\nfd32a8c5cd211b057fdf3e7cc27167296c71e3fb42daa488649cdf81f58f6848\\n\\nCommand-and-Control Servers\\n\\nIP Address Origin 78.142.0.42 US 79.137.207.233 Germany 185.216.68.97 Netherlands 193.164.150.225 Russia\\n\\nIoCs are available at https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/HomuWitch'),\n",

What we intentionally omitted in the blog post was that we had been aware of a cryptographic vulnerability in this ransomware for several months and, since August 2023, we had covertly provided victims with our decryption tool. Thanks to our collaboration with law enforcement units, we were able to quietly assist numerous organizations by decrypting their files for free, enabling them to regain functionality. Given the weakness in Rhysida ransomware was publicly disclosed recently, we are now publicly releasing our decryptor for download to all victims of the Rhysida ransomware.\\n\\nThe Rhysida ransomware has been active since May 2023. As of Feb 2024, their TOR site lists 78 attacked companies, including IT (Information Technology) sector, healthcare, universities, and government organizations.\\n\\nUsage of the Decryptor\\n\\nPlease, read the following instructions carefully. The rate of success depends on them.\\n\\nSeveral parameters of the infected PC affect the encryption (and decryption) of the files:\\n\\nSet of the drive letters\\n\\nOrder of files\\n\\nNumber of CPU cores\\n\\nBitness of the executed ransomware sample\\n\\nFormat of files before encryption\\n\\nFor these reasons, the following rules must be obeyed while decrypting files:\\n\\nThe decryptor must be executed on the same machine where the files were encrypted\\n\\nPassword cracking process must be executed on the same machine where the files were encrypted\\n\\nNo files from another machine can be copied to the machine where the decryption process is performed\\n\\nText files (source files, INI files, XML, HTML, …) must have certain minimal size to be decryptable\\n\\n64-bit samples of the Rhysida encryptors are far more common. For that reason, default configuration of the decryptor assumes 64-bit encryptor. If you are sure that it was 32-bit version (for example, if you have 32-bit operating system), the decryptor can be switched to 32-bit mode by using the following command line parameter:\\n\\navast_decryptor_rhysida.exe /ptr:32\\n\\nIf you want to verify whether the decryption process will work without changing the files, you may use the “testing mode” of the decryptor. This mode is activated by the following command line parameter:\\n\\navast_decryptor_rhysida.exe /nodecrypt\\n\\nThe Rhysida decryptor also relies on the known file format. Common file formats, such as Office documents, archives, pictures, and multimedia files are already covered. If your encrypted data includes valuable documents in less common or proprietary formats, please, contact us at decryptors@avast.com. We can analyze the file format and if possible, we add its support to the decryptor.\\n\\nSteps to Use the Decryptor\\n\\nDownload the decryptor here. Run the decryptor. Unless you need one or more command line modifications, you can simply run it by clicking on the downloaded file. On the initial page, you must confirm that you are running the decryptor on the same PC where the files were encrypted. Click Yes, then the Next button when you are ready to start.\\n\\nNext page shows the list of drive letters on the PC. You may notice that it is in reverse order. Please, keep it as it is and click “Next.”\\n\\nThe next screen requires you to enter an example of an encrypted file. In most cases, the decryptor picks the best file available for the password cracking process.\\n\\nThe next page is where the password cracking process takes place. Click Start when you are ready to begin. This process usually only takes a few seconds but will require a large amount of system memory.\\n\\nOnce the password is found, you can continue to decrypt all the encrypted files on your PC by clicking Next:\\n\\nOn the final page, you can opt-in to back up your encrypted files. These backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This choice is selected by default, which we recommend. After clicking Decrypt the decryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes decrypting all of your files.\\n\\nFor questions or comments about the Avast decryptor, email decryptors@avast.com.')]"

Due to the absence of a client update mechanism in case of C&C outage, this forced the project owners to produce new clients every few days. Later, they started distributing new clients exclusively via private messages, presumably to reduce information exposure.\\n\\nBreakdown of top-level domains targeted by DDosia\\n\\nTargets published on DDosia’s Telegram group\\n\\nThe requirement to manually update DDosia’s binary with each update along with frequent C&C outages resulted in a significant decrease in the impact of their attacks.

These attacks are often highly sophisticated, sometimes using multiple zero-day exploits to break into iOS devices without user interaction, with the intent of spying on their victims and extracting personal information such as SMS messages, contacts and photos. There has been more focus on the use of such spyware by governments, with Poland recently launching a probe into the use of Pegasus by the government, which allegedly targeted close to 600 individuals in Poland.

When a device supporting SMB is discovered, it is saved in a dedicated list. The same goes with IPs that don’t support SMB, effectively deny listing them from future actions.

Second, the code quality of built-in drivers is arguably higher than that of random third-party drivers, making vulnerabilities much more difficult to find. It’s also worth noting that – while patching tends to be ineffective at stopping BYOVD attacks (even if a vendor patches their driver, the attacker can still abuse the older, unpatched version of the driver) – patching a built-in driver will make the vulnerability no longer usable for this kind of zero-day attacks.'),\n",

This is a valid approach since the IOCTL handler’s first action is to check the input buffer size, and if it doesn’t match the expected size, it would just immediately return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER .\\n\\nTo check if it was successful, the exploit employs the NtWriteVirtualMemory syscall, attempting to read the current thread’s PreviousMode (Lazarus avoids using NtReadVirtualMemory , more on this later). If the exploit succeeded, the syscall should return STATUS_SUCCESS , and the leaked PreviousMode byte should equal 0 (meaning KernelMode ). Otherwise, the syscall should return an error status code, as it should be impossible to read kernel memory without a corrupted PreviousMode .'),\n",

It would make little sense for them to load a vulnerable driver, as they already established their kernel read/write primitive by exploiting a zero-day in a preinstalled Windows driver.

This allows it to craft a custom handle table entry with control over both the referenced object and the access bits. This way, it can conjure an arbitrary handle to any object, completely bypassing the check typically needed for handle acquisition. What’s more, if it sets the handle’s access bits appropriately, it will also satisfy the subsequent handle checks when performing its desired operations.'),\n",
